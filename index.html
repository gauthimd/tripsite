    <h2 class="even">Update 4/26</h2>
    <p>Well the last 12 hours or so have sucked ass. I got zero sleep. Two 
       nights ago I passed right out from exhaustion and my all night bus ride
       to get down here. That and there was myself and 2 other guys in this 
       shared dorm room at the hostel. Last night it was me and 4 other guys.
       There is no AC in the room, and the body heat from 5 people really made
       the room rediculously hot. I got up to smoke about 1 in the morning, only
       to find they padlocked the front gate into the building. They only have 1
       key to this padlock and the owner has it on the backside of the property.
       Between the dorm room and the back end of the property there is a 
       kitchen. Suddenly I realized if the kitchen were to catch fire in the 
       night, we're totally fucked. So between that and me sweating all over the
       bed sheets to the point I can't lay on them anymore, I spent most of the 
       night out in the courtyard, where there is a wall I could jump over in
       case a fire broke out. Strange I know, but being in a foreign country the
       US govt declares dangerous does not scare me. Fire and car accidents 
       scare me. Statistically speaking, Americans getting murdered or kidnapped
       in Mexico is actually exceedingly rare. It's just that when it happens it
       is so widely reported. Over 30,000 Americans die in car accidents every 
       year. That's fucking scary. 3500 Americans die every year in house fires.
       For the several several years, about 100 Americans die each year in 
       Mexico (of the 6 million Americans that come here each year). I digress.
       So one of the guys staying at the hostel with me spoke English, so I 
       asked him to translate for me my concerns to the staff, and that I was 
       leaving and wanted a refund for the 4 nights I wouldn't be staying here.
       After about 20 minutes of back and forth with he and the staff, he says
       to me they're not going to do it, and they're being pricks about it too. 
       Apparently he had paid for one night (smart thing to do) and was going to
       pay for 2 more nights, but they jacked the price up on him. He pulled up
       a listing for a hostel down the street for the same price he'd paid for 
       the first night and they refused. So he left too and assured them they're
       getting 2 shitty reviews, to which they didn't seem to care. So fuck that
       place, La Casa del Barrio. Can't say I'm super surprised, considering it
       was literally the cheapest place in all of Monterrey. So that's about 
       $44USD I'll never see again. Not too bad, but still I'm super pissed at
       those assholes. If I knew better Spanish I'd research how to report these
       guys for not having a fire escape. I know it's Mexico and all, but in
       every other hotel here (even the shitty ones) there were always clearly 
       marked multiple exits that were unlocked at all times from the inside. I
       can't imagine Mexico doesn't have some sort of regulation regarding fire 
       escapes. So anyways, fuck those guys. I'm now in my own room at a hotel
       (not a hostel) I found for about $30USD a night. So considering the $66
       I paid for a week at the hostel, plus the $120 for the 4 nights here, I'm
       still under $200 for a week. Not too shaby. So it's about 2pm, and I'm 
       going to bed finally. The AC in here works great, the bed is very 
       comfortable, and I have the room to myself. No hiking or exploring today,
       just relaxing and getting some sleep. New plan is to wake up super early
       and head off to the mountains. Finally got a pic of the Policía. Kinda
       sucks because I had to zoom all the way in from across the street, but
       you get the idea. You fuck with those guys, you're gonna have a bad 
       time. Hasta mañana!

    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/25</h2>
    <p>Went for a long walk this morning. It was about 6 miles by my Google 
       Earth measurements. First I set out to explore the Macroplaza which is 
       about a quarter mile from my hostel. It's pretty awesome. It's a really
       big park that has most of the official state buildings like the 
       courthouse, congress, and the capital building. Monterrey is the capital
       of the state of Nuevo Leon. Before I crossed the border last month, I was       unaware that Mexico is officially called Estados Unidos Mexicanos, which
       roughly translates to the United Mexican States. There's 31 states and
       one federal district (like we have 50 states and Washington D.C.). 
       Anyways, the Macroplaza is awesome. It's just a big park with sculptures,
       artisans selling random trinkety crap, and a bunch of people with these
       massage chairs setup where they'll give you a massage in the park. Kinda
       cool. I saw one guy paying the massage lady 20 pesos, which is like a
       dollar. Probably gets you like 5-10 min or something, but whatever. I'm
       not into massages, but can't deny how nifty and cheap that is. So after a
       long walk I decided to find some tacos. When I was here a few weeks ago
       I had the best barbacoa tacos I've ever had, so I set off to find that
       same place again. I went to la calle Liberdad, the street that I was sure
       it was on and started walking west. I went a mile and couldn't find it, 
       so I went up one street and walked the mile back towards the east where I
       came from. Couldn't find it. Disappointed I started back towards my 
       hostel. I decided I'd try east on Liberdad for a few blocks just in case
       it was a lot further down than I had remembered. Made it 1 block east 
       from where I started on Liberdad and there it was. Barbacoa tacos for 9 
       pesos a piece (a little less than 50 cents). The best part is that it's a
       lot closer to my hostel than I expected, like maybe 2/3 of a mile. So I'm
       going there every damn day. And for future reference, or anyone else who
       reads this and makes it down to Monterrey, it is the taqueria on la calle
       Liberdad between calles Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. You will not be 
       disappointed. Don't think it has a name, a lot of these places don't. So
       it's now 1pm. Decided to come back to my hostel and chill for the next 4
       to 5 hours, because in the middle of the day, it gets hot as hell, and 
       that's what got me sick last time. So I feel like I'm getting a little 
       better at this. Below is a pic of the capital, as well as the best $2
       lunch ever. Can anyone tell me what that green sauce is? I meant to ask
       but totally forgot when I went to pay. It's spicy as hell and DELICIOUS. 
       If it's something that's sold in the states I'm buying it and putting it
       on everything. Tonight when it cools off I'm going to explore downtown a
       little more, and tomorrow I'm going to get up early and head off to Cerro
       de la Silla. There's a lot more great pics of the Macroplaza in my 
       Dropbox, and I'll probably add more to it later tonight. Adiós!</p><br>

    <h2 class="even">Update 4/24</h2>
    <p>Back in Monterrey. Made it to my hostel about 2 hours ago. I was able to
       sleep a little bit on the bus from Austin to Laredo, but afterwards nada.
       When you take a bus across the border they pull into this designated area
       where everyone gets off and you show them your passport and get a visa if
       needed. Then you put your luggage thru an xray machine and they herd you
       back onto the bus. The whole thing took almost 3 hours. Pretty different
       from when I just walked across the border last time. Anyways I'm pretty 
       tired. When I got off the bus my first mission was to find an ATM and get
       a metrorail ticket to get across town to my hostel. So unlike all other
       bus stations in Mexico, Greyhound stations don't have ATMs. So I go to 
       the nearest gas station, and their ATM is out of order. So I go to the 
       metrorail station and find an ATM. For whatever reason, it won't read my
       card. I walk back towards the bus station and go to the Pemex on the 
       other side. They have no ATM, unlike every other Pemex I went to in all
       of Mexico. So I go sit in the bus station to use their wifi to find more
       Oxxo and Pemex stations. Found another Pemex about a mile away. Luckily
       this one had one that works. So I had to walk back to the metrorail
       station where I was finally able to buy a ticket. The metrorail is pretty
       great. They come every 10 min or so and it took maybe 20 min to get all
       the way across town. My hostel is a quarter mile away from the last stop        and it's in a really nice part of town. If you step outside and walk to 
       the end of the street there's a pretty fantastic view of las montañas and
       Cerro de la Silla. Probably not gonna do any hiking tomorrow. Just gonna
       rest, wander, and eat tacos. Since I got back from the first trip, I've 
       been studying Spanish at least 8 hours everyday. I was home about 9 or 10       days before I came back, but WOW what a difference. It's kinda surreal. 
       I'm at the point where I can hear and recognize about 80% of the words in
       any given conversation. I can 'instantly' translate only about a third. 
       I studied enough grammar at this point that this time I can put actual
       sentences together, instead of just a noun or two. Still tho, hearing and
       immediately recognizing what is said is difficult. That's gonna take some
       time. Spanish sentence structure is a little screwy, and don't get me 
       started on pronouns. Lo, tu, ti, su, sus, etc... oh man I just don't get
       it yet. Either way I'm super impressed with myself. I've been studying
       Spanish intensely about 2 months now, and never would've guessed I'd be
       this far. I always figured gaining fluency in another language would be
       tricky, and it totally is. Especially considering I haven't thought about
       what a predicate is since 7th grade. Anyways, no plans for the rest of 
       the day but relax and eat tacos. I uploaded a few more pics, nothing 
       special. The pic below is of Topo Chico. If you've ever heard of that
       bottled mineral water by the same name, well this is the mountain it
       comes from. I read they grab the runoff from springs on the mountain 
       then purify it, bottle it, and sell it. Hasta luego!</p><br>

    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/23</h2>
    <p>So, I decided to go back to Mexico. I really miss it, I've been studying
       Spanish constantly since I got back, and I really miss the food. After
       doing some research I booked round trip Greyhound tickets Austin to 
       Monterrey for $46 and 6 nights in a hostel for about $11 a night. I 
       couldn't help myself. I had to come back to one of my favorite cities
       for a week. Bus leaves at 1:40am so I'll be in Monterrey about 10am
       Monday morning. I'll probably update the site every 2 or 3 days, but I
       plan to do some hiking up the local mountains, which should yield some
       pretty awesome pics.</p><br>
    <h2 class="even">Update 4/16</h2>
    <p>June 27th, 2017 (a little more than 10 weeks from now) I'm flying back
       into Cancún, bussing into Belize, and continuing right where I left off.
       This gives me 10 weeks of intense Spanish prep, as well as some actual 
       planning for this trip now that I actually have an idea of what I'm 
       getting myself into. I plan to spend about a week in each of the 7 
       Central American countries and probably 1.5-2 weeks each in Costa Rica 
       and Panama. All on a minimal budget that includes campsites, hostels, and
       couchsurfing. The website will probably change a little between now and 
       when I leave, as I learn a little more and experiment with different 
       layouts.</p><br> 
    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/15</h2>
    <p>Back in Tyler, TX as of yesterday. Long story short, heat exhaustion in
       Tulum and a very cheap flight home. Here to regroup, get a better handle
       on Spanish, and I'm planning my trip back to Central America. No date
       picked yet, but I'll post here and probably let everyone know anyhow.
       Great pics from Tulum. Just started to feel very sick after a day of 
       walking in the heat, it was the 4th time I'd overdone it, so I felt it 
       best to come home and recover a while. I've lost 10lbs, which is not good
       for my size. I'm fine, more or less recovered at this point. Thanks for
       reading and keeping up with me. I love you all :-)</p><br>

    <h2 class="even">Update 4/11</h2>
    <p>Today was Chichén Itzá!! Ok so unlike Teotihuacán, where I loved every
       second of it, Chichén Itzá definitely has some pros and cons. Cons: It is
       definitely a tourist trap. Thousands of people, hundreds of pushy vendors
       literally all selling the same trinkets and such, and the line to buy a
       ticket to get in was an hour long. At Teotihuacán there was no line and I
       felt like I had the place to myself. And maybe like a half dozen vendors.
       Honestly what did I expect? Most people showed up on these fancy tour
       buses from Cancún or a cruise or something, and let's face it, not many
       people vacation to Mexico City. Ok pros: it's actually pretty sweet. El
       Castillo is the main building everyone thinks of regarding Chichén Itzá
       but it's actually just the centerpiece to a pretty big ancient city. I
       walked around out there for a few hours and kept being surprised when I
       found something new. I've got lots of pics and I want to say I found at
       least 90% of what's out there, but I could be wrong. It was 95 degrees so
       at the end of it I was exhausted and starving. At the visitors center
       they have this fancy restaurant and I didn't want any snack food crap so
       I figured, whatever, I'll splurge on this meal. Ordered this giant piece
       of fajita meat that came with chicken enchiladas, beans, a slab of cheese
       and homemade lemonade. Out here in the Yucatán they accept American 
       currency as well, so it gave me a chance to use some I came with. 
       Expecting a fancy ass meal like this to be around $30 or so, imagine my
       shock at $16. Hot damn I love Mexico. Afterwards I hopped on a bus for
       Tulum, which is where I'm at now. Found a decent hotel. My plan is to
       wake up and go see the ruins here, but first I'm going to buy a bus 
       ticket for Belize! The plan is to see the ruins in the morning and bus it
       in the evening into Belize, but we'll see if the bus schedules work out
       that way. If not I may just try and hitch a ride south. We'll see. 
       Either way my time in Mexico is coming to an end. It was more amazing
       than I ever expected. Aside from a couple asshole cops in Mexico City, I
       didn't really have any negative experiences here. Even the cop thing was
       extremely tame compared to what cops in the US have put me through. Yeah
       me and cops, we go way back. Anyways, yesterday I didn't really do much.
       Walked around Cancún a little more. Had 2 of the best tamales I've ever
       had for like 30 pesos (around $1.80). The kid I bought them from couldn't
       have been more than 11. That actually bothers me a little. I've seen boys
       and girls 10 or younger standing on the same corner selling food or 
       trinkets or whatever for HOURS. Definitely a little depressing. I gotta 
       admit tho, the absolute best AND cheapest food you will find down here is
       from street vendors. They got their shit down, and with zero overhead
       they pass the savings on to you! So hells yeah for Mexico. Gonna miss it.
       Coming back for sure. If any of you wanna make a weekend trip down to 
       Monterrey, I'm so down. Greyhound has a daily trip from Austin to 
       Monterrey and back. No reason not to. Don't listen to the American fear
       porn. They want you to think the rest of the world is this dark dangerous
       place where everyone hates Americans because we're free or something.
       That's crap. It's war propaganda. Divide and conquer. There's criminals
       in every single country, but everyday people are just like everyday 
       people in the US. Everyone wants to be happy. Everyone wants what's best
       for their kids. Everyone is curious about the world, so go explore it!
       Ok I'm done for the night. I'm just gonna miss Mexico so damn much. I 
       love you all :-)</p><br>

    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/9 afternoon</h2>
    <p>Alright so my sleep schedule is totally fucked, but whatever. I'm in 
       tropical paradise, the cost of living is like $30USD/day (shit hotel), 
       and I couldn't be happier. Didn't sleep at all last night, went for a 
       stroll along the beach this morning and wasn't disappointed. A few pics 
       and a vid, check'em out. If there wasn't a beautiful young girl at home 
       awaiting my return, I honestly probably wouldn't (seriously miss you like
       crazy Vanna:). Not making any short-term plans; the bus rides pissed me 
       off. Don't I deserve this? Tranny hookers and aggressive cabbies/street 
       vendors aside, I'm fucking loving this place. "No gracias" is my go-to
       phrase. My stress level is now at like -5 or something. Or is that +5
       bliss? Whatever, this place is the shit. BTW sorry for my foul language.
       If you don't know me that well, I'm a bit of a character. Shocker right?
       Hitchhiking and busing thru Mexico, who fucking does that?! This guy. 
       Again, I love you all, your WhatsApp texts make me smile; keep'em
       coming. Nap time and we'll see what the next day brings. Sorry the days
       aren't as adventurous as the first few, but I'm literally trying to take
       it easy.</p><br>

    <h2 class="even">Update 4/9 middle of the night</h2>
    <p>Alright it's 4 in the morning but this was totally worthy of a post. I 
       slept about 9 hours this afternoon once I got to a hotel, so naturally
       I'm having a bit of trouble sleeping. I walk to the store for a pack of
       cigs. It's down the street. I'm smoking my last one before I walk 
       inside. This OBVIOUS tranny walks up to me and grabs my dick. "You want
       fuck, you want suck? I make you feel real good Americano." LOL "No 
       gracias, no gracias!", I keep saying. I guess the awkward smile led 
       her/him/it on cause she wouldn't let go. Literally had to grab her arm 
       and remove it from my crotch. I walk inside the store. Two employees and
       about 4 customers are laughing their asses off, apparently seeing this
       whole debacle. OMG Cancún. WTF?! Gonna be an interesting few days...</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/8</h2>
    <p>Ok so 18 hours on the bus. Define misery. Just got to a hotel. Haven't
       slept in a while. Gonna chill here in Cancún a few days. No new pics yet.
       Gonna sleep as long as I can. Should have lots more pics tomorrow night.
       Thought the waving flag was a nice touch :)
    </p><br>
    <h2 class="even">Update 4/7 afternoon</h2>
    <p>I got about 5 hours sleep. Woke up and decided to bite the bullet and 
       take the bus all the way out to Cancún. Sitting here at the bus station
       currently. Gonna be a 15 hour bus ride. Gonna stay in Cancún for at least
       a couple days and use it as my final base of operations here in Mexico.
       I'll take a day trip out to Chichén Itzá, spend a day at the ruins in 
       Cancún, and I'll hit up Tulum on my way south into Belize. I'm definitely
       pretty exhausted at this point. These bus rides are pretty draining
       but it's the cheapest and quickest way for me to cover the distance I 
       need to get to where I want to go. I'm guessing I'll be in Mexico another
       3-4 days, and then Part 2 of my adventure begins when I hit Central 
       America! Saw a couple iguanas on my walk to the bus station this morning
       but I was too slow with the camera. I'm sure I'll see more. I'll be in 
       Cancún about 930am tomorrow and the plan is to get a hotel, do some much
       needed laundry, and then sleep for 12 hours if I can. No new pics yet.
       However I'm sure that'll change when I get to Cancún. Adiós!
    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/7 morning</h2>
    <p>Ever been on a bus for 11 hours? Well it sucks. Woke up yesterday in 
       Oaxaca and bought a bus ticket for Coatzacoalcos. Can you pronounce that?
       Me neither. Basically showed a map to the ticket clerk and said "Aquí!"
       Eleven hours later, here we are. The bus station here is pretty nice,
       but being dropped off at 330 in the morning left me wondering whether I
       should sleep at the bus station to avoid paying for a night for 7 hours.
       Decided to have a taxi drive me a couple miles into town to the cheapest
       hotel I could find. It was in the middle of town and at 4 in the morning,
       it's a freakin ghost town. Cabbie drops me off and zooms off. I walk 
       into the hotel and immediately the guy starts shaking his head no, "No
       tengo" was all I got. OK, so now I'm in the middle of this town at 4 in
       the morning. Pull up the GPS, nearest hotel is a mile. Long story short,
       I spent an hour walking around and hit up 3 hotels before I found one 
       with room. So here we are. Got 6.5 hours til checkout and for some reason
       I'm not really tired. Before it got dark the ride today was absolutely
       beautiful. I got some pretty great pics out the window. Oaxaca is like
       the last city in Mexico that's in the desert region. From here to the
       Yucatán it's green and lots of palm trees and humid. I like it. I'm
       working my way towards Merida. That's the closest city to the remaining
       ruins I want to see here in Mexico. After a night in Merida I'll hit up
       Chichén Itzá on my way into Cancún. There's ruins there too, so I'll 
       see if I can find a cheap hotel there, and then I'll hit up Tulum on my
       way down into Belize. I think I can hit all that up in about 4-5 days,
       but the bus ride from here to Merida is gonna be like another 11 hours,
       maybe more. I could be wrong. Part of the reason the ride today took so
       long is because most of the trip was on this winding mountain road. We
       were going probably about 45mph. Looks like it's mostly highway from here
       to Merida, but still it's a long freakin ways. Turns out Mexico is big. 
       Takes a while to get places. Hope you all enjoy the pics. Hit me up on
       WhatsApp whenever.</p><br><br>

    <h2 class="even">Update 4/5 evening</h2>
    <p>So today has been a pretty lazy day for me, so I figured I'd upgrade the
       site a little bit with some pics and share a few more reflections on my
       time here in Mexico. I've been here a week now. If my stress level on 
       day one was a 10, I'm now down to about a 2. My fears of being randomly
       kidnapped or murdered by cartel or federalies has diminished to zero. 
       Obviously I'm still taking regular precautions. Don't walk around late
       at night. If an area gives me a bad vibe, I leave. And get this, only 1
       homeless person has asked me for change. One! Honestly, there's a 
       shitload more homeless people walking the streets in the US than I've 
       seen in any city I've been to down here. I'm trying not to be surprised
       by things like this. I've known for years American media is horseshit.
       If there's one thing I've learned so far it's that if you let mainstream
       media or Hollywood movies dictate your worldview regarding any particular
       culture or country, you are most likely incredibly misinformed. Fear 
       sells. OK I'm done with that little rant.<br>Rant number 2. My only
       real issue with Mexico is their electrical infrastructure. As someone
       who does electrical work and is very familiar with electrical code, well
       I can't walk a single block without seeing code violations. When wires
       come off the transformers and go to the weather head and down into the
       meter, I've seen wires twisted together with no wire nuts/tape or 
       anything, meters with the covers completely removed, and all other sorts
       of uncovered electrical boxes. I just keep thinking some drunk dumbass
       could stumble right into that and game over. The meters with no covers
       is exceptionally dangerous because the entire current load for buildings
       runs thru those 2 wires. You can be shocked with millions of volts or 
       more from a taser, cattle prod, or electric fence because there is 
       essentially zero current that runs thru them. It's just high voltage. It
       will stop you dead in your tracks but it's non-lethal because of the 
       lack of current. If you touch 2 bare wires or bus bars on one of these
       uncovered meters, we're talking potentially hundreds of amps. And get 
       this, 1 amp will kill you. Get your electrical shit together Mexico.<br>
       OK rant 3. Street performers. This is actually pretty cool. I first saw
       this in Monterrey and then everywhere in Mexico City. At stop lights
       people will stand in the middle of the street and juggle, breakdance,
       or do that fire-breathing stuff with a torch and everclear. When the
       light turns green they jump to the lines between the lanes and collect
       money from people as they pass by. This is what impresses me the most:
       people ALWAYS stop and give them change. The light will be green but cars
       will slow down, sometimes to a complete stop, and hand them change out 
       the window. At any given traffic light if there's time for a dozen cars
       to make it thru, usually only 6 will make it because of the people 
       stopping to give change to the performers. Nobody honks, cusses, or 
       anything at them. It's just part of everyday life if you drive around  
       here. I always just laugh to myself about how this would not fly in the
       US. If you hesitate or hold up a traffic light for like 2 seconds in the
       US, you're gonna hear about it from cars around you. I know how to 
       juggle, so I figured if I get mugged or lose my backpack, phone, and 
       everything I can do this for water/food money til I figure out how to 
       contact home. Always good to have a worst-case scenario plan :-)<br>
       Dinner time for me. And oh man, legit Mexican kicks ass. Thank God I love
       spice. I don't think they know how to cook it without.
    </p><br>
    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/5</h2>
    <p>Yesterday morning was amazing. The hotel I stayed at in Teotihuacán was
       really nice and the breakfast was even better. Afterwards I spent around
       3 hours at the pyramid complex. It was truly amazing. Of all the tourist
       type places I've ever been to, this was my absolute favorite. The size of
       the 2 pyramids is astounding, not to mention the surrounding architecture
       of the city on the Avenue of the Dead. I've got lots of pics and a few
       vids in my dropbox. I decided I wanted to explore the town some before I
       headed back into Mexico City. At this point, I'm anxious to get out to 
       the Yucatán so I got a bus ticket for Oaxaca. Expecting about a 6 hour
       drive, we made several stops and the traffic in Mexico City is insane, so
       it ended up being about a 9 hour drive. That was pretty exhausting. Got
       to Oaxaca about 130 in the morning last night and got a cheap hotel 
       across the street from the bus station. I got plenty of sleep last night
       but I'm still feeling exhausted, so I'm going to spend another day here
       in Oaxaca. No real plan as of yet, just to find some food and mail home
       this blanket I bought at Teotihuacán (pic of it in dropbox). Needed 
       something to remember my new favorite place on Earth. I'm sure I'll be 
       back someday when I find someone as crazy as me willing to fly into
       Mexico City to go check them out. Honestly if I could do yesterday over
       again, I would've spent more time at the complex and stayed an extra 
       night out there, and just gotten up early to head to Oaxaca. Oh well,
       this whole trip has been a learning experience and I'm definitely no 
       expert on this solo international travel stuff...yet. Feeling super lazy
       today, and I have no real plan for the next few days, so when I get all
       that figured out I'll post it here. Hope you enjoy the pics and vids
       from yesterday. It was definitely the highlight of my trip thus far.</p>

    <h2 class="even">Update 4/3</h2>
    <p>So once upon a time in Mexico...I woke up in San Luis Potosí and headed
       for the bus station. When you're trying to get 400km in a day, and bus
       tickets are like 8 bucks, well that doesn't take a genius. So off to 
       Mexico City. I haven't seen anything like Mexico City since Cairo. It's
       huge, it's a maze, everything is painted in these bright strange colors,
       just take a look at the photos. Sorry they're all from out of a bus 
       window, but you get the idea. So I get off the bus at the station and 
       I'm in a daze. Thousands of people, no clue which way is the exit, so I
       decide to spark up a cigarrette (I wanted to quit on this trip, but $2
       a pack?!) and tried to get my bearings. I'm standing there maybe 45 
       seconds and out of thousands of people these 2 fucking cops walk right
       up to me. Thankfully, they look like normal cops, and not those special
       forces looking guys I saw back in Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. They start
       asking me something and I just respond with "habla ingles?" To which I 
       get no response and they motion for me to remove my backpack and put it
       on the ground in front of me. One starts digging thru it, the other asks
       for my ID. "Drogas?" one asked. "No" I replied. "Armas?" Again I shook 
       my head no. I decided to pull my Swiss Army knife out of my pocket and 
       showed him. He looked unimpressed and I pointed to the taser I have in 
       the mesh pocket on the side of my bag. He takes a look at it, and the 
       other cop decides to give up. There's like 4 main zippers on my backpack
       and he gave up after digging thru the first 2 after finding only 
       my clothes and some charging cables for my phone and laptop. I mean, I 
       kinda get it. I was sticking out like a sore thumb. Only white guy there
       with a bigger backpack than anyone else. I guess they were satisfied
       after seeing it's not stuffed to the brim with coke or something. 
       That and I was as cooperative as I could've been. The cop handed me my
       ID and they just walked off. OK, so time to get the fuck out of here, 
       I'm thinking. Find the entrance to the bus station. You know that scene
       from Men in Black where Will Smith walks into the MIB headquarters for 
       the first time, and it's like this intergalactic waystation? That's 
       what I felt like. I wish I got pics of this place but I was still so 
       shook up over the cop thing I just wanted to keep moving. I walk outside
       the bus station, still no real plan and realize if I take one step into
       this maze of a city, I'm getting lost, GPS or no. Ok, back into the bus
       station! I find a terminal that says Teotihuacán, exactly where I want 
       to go. Two dollars and a bus leaving in 5 minutes. Awesome! Drops me off
       on the north end of the pyramid complex. The town of Teotihuacán is so
       cool. Imagine Santa Fe, but like 100 times better. All kinds of shops,
       not too crowded, and everything is decked out in Mayan shit. It's really
       cool. I walked down to the pyramid complex entrance about 630, but they
       were closed for the evening. So I walked back to the hotel, ate some 
       food, went to my room and here we are. Tomorrow is going to kick so much
       ass. Freaking cannot wait to get to those pyramids!!!</p><br>

    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/2</h2>
    <p>Today was a long bus ride. Woke up in Linares. The bus station was about
       a mile walk from the hotel. I caught a bus to the town of Matehuala, 
       which was about 6 hours away, where I switched buses and rode another 2
       hours or so down to the town of San Luis Potosí. SLP is a big city. 
       Honestly if everything wasn't in spanish, you'd think it was McAllen or
       Brownsville or something. The best part of the ride today was the first
       hour outside Linares. We took this winding road thru the mountains, the
       same range that extends all the way up to Monterrey. After that it was
       desert. Honestly the scenery reminded me a lot of the trip Ricky and I 
       took to the Grand Canyon a few years back. A lot of it looked like New
       Mexico and a lot of it looked like Arizona. It's that desert look with
       sparse hills/mountains with all types of cacti and other desert plants.
       I took a lot of pics out the bus window and they're uploaded to my
       dropbox. When I got to SLP there were about 6 hotels within walking
       distance of the bus station. At this point I'm kinda anxious to get out
       to the Mayan ruins. Tomorrow I'm going to bus it to Mexico City. It's 
       gonna be another long bus ride, but I feel like it would take me days 
       hitchhike down there. My only goal for Mexico City is to see 
       Teotihuacán. After that I'll probably bus it to Oaxaca, tool around for
       a day, and then bus it out to the Yucatán. Then the fun really begins.
       Mayan ruins, pristine beaches, tropical weather, jungles, howler monkeys.
       Oh man it's gonna kick ass.</p><br>

    <p>Well I woke up feeling pretty weird. With the 10 miles of walking in the
       Mexican sol, I think I overdid it a little yesterday. I'm worried if I
       press on today I'll just make myself sick. So I paid for another night 
       in this nice hotel here in Linares where I'm gonna sleep some more and
       do some planning for the next few days. Time for a siesta but hit me up
       on WhatsApp anytime. Pic is from rooftop of Linares hotel.</p><br>

    <h2 class="odd">Update 3/31 evening</h2>
    <p>Again, what a day. After the interview I wandered thru Monterrey. I 
       uploaded a map of my route thru the city. It was 8.5 miles before the 
       gas station where I got my first ride. Nice guy, gave me a ride about 10
       miles south. Let me out at an Oxxo (gas stations that are everywhere 
       here) and the first truck I asked gave me a ride into Santiago, about 
       another 20-30 miles south. There were 3 guys and me in this truck, and
       I couldn't understand any of them. Like at all. They were absolutely
       hilarious. They offered me a cerveza and I showed them my bottle of 
       water. They laughed and I'm pretty sure I heard pinche cabrón. They
       were speaking that rapid fire español and literally every sentence I 
       heard chinga/chingada. They kept asking me questions and when I 
       responded with 'no se' they just kept laughing at me. Honestly I'm 
       pretty sure the whole situation would have made a lot of people 
       uncomfortable, but I thought it was awesome. I snuck a pic from
       the backseat, it's the one with the older fellow driving. They let me 
       out at an Oxxo in Santiago, where I walked a couple more hours and had
       the best (and cheapest) barbacoa tacos I've ever had. I ended up at
       a Pemex (the other major gas station here) which is where I met Ezekial.
       This guy was awesome. He spoke literally no english, but spoke real slow
       for me and miraculously I feel like I had pretty great conversation with
       him. He drove me down to Linares, which is where I'm at now. When we got
       to town, he drove me around a little bit and we ended up at a barber 
       shop (literally on this guy's front porch, great pic of it in dropbox) 
       where I waited and chatted while he got his hair cut. After he was done
       he drove me to the hotel I'm at now. He said a prayer for me and asked
       God to protect me on my journey. It's been things like this that have me
       somewhat overwhelmed and emotional. I'm not naíve. I know what I'm doing
       is kinda crazy and relatively dangerous. I've put my faith in the 
       everyday people of a country I know nothing about, and it's been paying
       dividends out the ass. I can't explain it, it's just amazing. I'll never
       look at Mexico the same again. The war with the narcos/cartels is 
       definitely very real. All the locals talk about it. There's definitely a
       horrible situation going on down here with extreme violence, but I fear
       the American media has hyped the situation up so much that most people
       would never even imagine that the overwhelming majority of the Mexican 
       population are wonderful, friendly, generous people. The Polizia look
       mean as fuck. They drive around in these tricked out trucks with this
       gate type thing they stand on in the back with machine gun mounts. Mostly       M-16s, but in Nuevo Laredo I saw one sporting a .50 cal. They're decked
       out head to toe in Kevlar and wear fucking ski masks so all you see is
       their eyes. This morning when I was walking thru Monterrey, I rounded a 
       corner in a barrio I was a little nervous about, and found myself 
       immediately face-to-face with 2 of these guys holding M-16s. They either
       saw my hesitation or my eyes widen, cause they both gave me a gentle nod
       and I just kept walking. Honestly it made me feel a little better. 
       Considering these guys are armed to the fucking teeth, I get the feeling
       dicking with some gringo backpacker is super low on their priority list.
       Well that's probably enough for tonight. Ezekial convinced me to take a
       bus from Linares to San Luis Potosí. Apparently it's super beautiful and
       all the guys at the barber shop were talking about how much safer it is
       there, especially considering what I'm doing. So who am I to argue with 
       the locals? Check the dropbox link, got a couple dozen or so more pics 
       added. The bus ride will be pretty long tomorrow, so the day will
       probably be pretty tame by comparison. I love you all. Thanks for reading
       and chatting with me on WhatsApp. Makes me feel not so far from home.</p>

       to move forward, I would come home April 15th. So I'm going to be

       to head towards the highway to hitch a ride south.</p><br>

    <h2 class="odd">Update 3/30</h2>
    <p>Well holy hell what a couple days it's been. Crossed the Rio Grande into        Nuevo Laredo yesterday morning about 630am. Walked about 5-7 miles thru
       the city and was able to hitch a ride from a trucker headed to Monterrey.       Finding free wifi down here is tricky. None of the usual shops have it,
       and even after purchasing a Telcel SIM card with data, it works but the 
       coverage is spotty even in the middle of the city. I ended up getting a 
       hotel for the night and was able to connect to their internet. Since then       I've upgraded my Verizon service to global. Think that should work better       moving forward. Anyhow, I woke up today exhausted and slightly sunburned.       Been walking about the city and eating random food from street vendors,         which are literally on every corner here. My spanish sucks, but I know 
       enough to get by. Started to hear it a little better too. I'm staying in        the same hotel again tonight, because I need reliable internet for a 
       Skype interview I have with a company back in Austin tomorrow morning.
       Tomorrow after the interview I'll be headed south toward San Luis Potosi.       Not sure if I'll make it that far, but that's the plan. As far 
       as safety and everything, I never really felt unsafe anywhere, even the
       border town. The people here are very friendly, and as soon as I start 
       speaking my shit spanish, many reply with shit english and we make it
       work from there. It's been a bit stressful at times, mostly because of
       the language barrier, but the experience of everything so far is totally
       making it worth it. </p><br>
