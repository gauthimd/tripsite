    <h2 class="even">Update 3/23/2018</h2>
    <p>Never a dull moment in Mexico. So yesterday Ricky flew back home. I
       took the subway with him to the airport and it took a good while to
       actually find the Southwest kiosk. The airport is pretty huge, and 
       there's dozens and dozens of airlines flying in and out and Southwest
       only has one little kiosk on the 2nd level all the way at the end.
       So after seeing Ricky off I went back to the subway. I read about this
       huge market called Merced so that's where I headed. It's pretty awesome.
       Reminded me of the grand bazar in Cairo. Vendors packed like sardines, 
       touts outside yelling shit in spanish, taco stands everywhere. I sat 
       down at this little taco shack and immediately this 12 yr old girl
       comes up and sits down next to me and starts chatting me up. She was
       talking real fast and I didn't gather much of what she said, so she
       gets up and brings her sister over, who I found out was 13. For whatever
       reason, I could understand her sister a little better and they ask 
       where I'm from, what I'm doing here, how old I am, that sort of thing.
       I was feeling kinda strange about the whole thing but it was actually
       pretty adorable. I'm pretty sure they were the daughters of the woman
       running the taqueria. I sat and attempted to chat a while and eventually
       got up and left. You could wander thru that market for days and still
       not see everything. They even had what looked like slot machines or 
       something to that effect. Eventually I went back to the subway and rode
       around a while just getting off at random stops. Each time I never went
       too far from the station, but I just wanted to get off in random areas
       to get a feel for each area. I loved it. The city is absolutely huge and
       no matter where you are it's packed with people. I carry my wallet in my
       front pocket and usually have my hand over it when I'm packed in the 
       subway or literally sardined in with other people wherever I happen to
       be. I have yet to feel threatened in any way but I certainly am taking
       precautions against pickpockets. I ended up at my Airbnb as the sun was 
       going down and just chilled here and went down the street for my dinner
       tacos. One thing that has kinda aggrevated me is that I have yet to 
       find barbacoa anywhere. Of the literal hundreds of taco stands/shacks
       that I've seen, none have had barbacoa. It was everywhere in Monterrey,
       so I'm guessing it must be a regional thing or something. I've asked
       and I either got funny looks, or an immediate no. So that was yesterday.
       Today I got up and walked to a taco stand and then hit the subway again.
       I ended up getting off at Zocalo, which is the downtown of Mexico City.
       It was pretty amazing, and from what I understand is the 2nd largest 
       city square on Earth, next to Tiannemen. I wandered thru parks, shops,
       and markets for several hours. I didn't really have a direction picked,
       I just wandered. Every 4 or 5 blocks or so I'd look at the map on my 
       phone to get my bearings, and kept walking. Just wanted to make sure 
       that wherever I went I was heading in the general direction of another
       metro station. So everything was going great until I stopped for lunch.
       It's kinda funny how the difference of like 2 or 3 blocks can put you 
       in a bad locale. I suddenly found myself in a market that looked like
       all the rest, but now I'm seeing working girls everywhere. I was getting
       pretty hungry and I found this woman cooking quesadillas. A lot of these
       little stands have 1 table and several chairs sitting around it, and 
       there were these 2 lady cops sitting there eating quesadillas. Thinking
       this should be just fine, I pulled up a chair next to these 2 cops. A
       mistake I won't make again. It started out fine. I smiled at them, they 
       smiled back, and before I finished eating these 3 working girls ordered
       quesadillas and sat down at the table as well. It was one of those 
       funny moments where I couldn't help but laugh to myself about where I 
       was. Eating quesadillas in a crowded market in Mexico City at a table
       with 2 cops and 3 hookers. I feel like I'm the only person I know who
       ends up in situations like this. So I finish eating and I'm ready to 
       pay, and I ask the woman how much, and I give her a 100 pesos. It was
       16 pesos but that was the smallest bill I had. Suddenly the cops start
       talking to me, and I have no fucking clue what they're saying. I 
       couldn't tell if they were asking where I was from, or where I was 
       going, so I tell them I'm from Texas. Obviously not the answer to their
       question. She asks if she wrote it down if I'd understand, and I said 
       yes. So she pulls out a pen and paper and writes "En esta zona te
       robarse" <i>In this area you will get robbed</i> To which I replied 
       entiendo <i>I understand.</i> They ask me where I'm trying to go. I 
       told them my hotel is 2 blocks north of the Etiopia metro station, so
       I'm going to a metro station. They say something about the Candelaria 
       metro station, and I'm like yeah thanks. I get up to leave and one of
       the cops stops me and asks me to wait. At this point I'm thinking, look
       lady, I appreciate your concern, but I can take care of myself, and 
       there's like a thousand people right fucking here. I get that I'm not 
       fluent, and I see that I've accidently walked into hooker central but 
       I'm not as dumb as I look. She pays for her meal and asks me to walk
       with her. Whatever, I'm thinking. So after walking a few blocks I'm 
       starting to feel more and more uneasy about the whole thing. She seemed
       pretty harmless, but I have no idea if she's corrupt and about to rob
       me herself, or lead me to a gang of thugs, or what. And I'm definitely
       attracting attention at this point because I'm walking thru this market
       with a fucking police escort. Finally after about 6 or 7 blocks we 
       arrive at the Candelaria metro station and she leaves me as soon as we
       walk inside. I thank her and go about my day. Starting to get close to
       dark so I take the metro to a stop about a mile from my Airbnb. Walked
       the mile or so back to my room, bought a tamale, and now here I am,
       safe and sound. So the lesson here today was DO NOT INTERACT WITH COPS.
       I think once they realized I could barely understand anything they were
       saying they just assumed this stupid gringo is gonna get his ass robbed
       or worse, and they just couldn't let it go until they escorted me to a
       metro. Whatever. I plan on doing the same shit tomorrow, but I won't be
       going back to that spot, and I sure as shit won't be sitting down to 
       eat lunch with fucking cops. </p><br>
    <h2 class="odd">Update 3/21/2018</h2>
    <p>I'm back in Mexico!!! And yes, I'm loving every second of it. I can't 
       explain why. I think it has something to do with the fact that it is
       so completely different from the US, and I'm comfortable here. It took
       a little while to get this way. International travel can be difficult.
       It's definitely a skill, and I think that's what I appreciate about it.
       I love learning new skills. It's my driving force. My spanish is better
       than last year but oh man do I have a ways to go before I'm fluent. So
       Ricky is here with me this time, which has been pretty awesome. He's 
       leaving tomorrow, but the time we've spent here has been very productive.
       We drove to Houston in the middle of the night to fly out of Houston. 
       Got to Mexico City about 10am and hopped on the subway out to the bus 
       station. The subway in Mexico City is the cheapest in the entire world.
       5 pesos (about 27 cents USD) gets you on, and basically you can ride
       anywhere in the city until you actually leave the subway. We got to 
       Autobuses del Norte and hopped on a bus to Teotihuacan for 52 pesos
       (about $2.80 USD). The bus didn't take the same route as last time, so 
       we actually ended up getting off about 3 miles from the hotel I had booked.
       Walked to the hotel, had dinner and just basically chilled for a while.
       When we showed up at the hotel, I told the hotel receptionist that we had 
       a reservation, but that didn't really seem to come into play. She happily
       gave us a key, billed me for the room, which I later calculated was only
       for one night (I had booked 2). Around 10 or 11pm we were just hanging out
       on the deck chilling and talking and realized that literally every light 
       in the entire hotel was off. No receptionist, no other guests, just nobody. 
       It was pretty creepy. I honestly think the entire staff had left. There
       were definitely some communication issues when we checked in, and we're 
       not sure if word got back to management that there were people staying there
       that first night. It literally felt like we were the only people in the 
       entire hotel, which was creepy as hell. I went out a couple times to smoke
       a cig, but no lights were on anywhere, and the only sounds you could hear
       where the howling of the hundreds of stray dogs that literally just roam 
       the streets around here. Around 7 or 8am the staff starts showing up, and
       breakfast gets served at 9, which was pretty fantastic, aside from the
       coffee, which totally sucked ass. They put cane sugar or some nastiness in
       it, and didn't really taste like coffee. After breakfast we headed out to 
       the pyramids. I absolutely love that place. There were hundred of people 
       there this time. March 20-21 they have this massive ceremony going on where
       people dressed in white are doing this ritual to celebrate the vernal 
       equinox. They do this whole dance ritual at the base of the pyramid, all 
       dressed in white, and there's people on top of Pyramid of Sun reaching 
       towards the sky praising the sun. I thought it was cool as shit. I took 
       part and reached out towards the sky a few times and listened to this 
       older woman giving this sort of sermon. She saw me smiling at her and 
       as I walked by said "Bienvenidos!" (Welcome) Made me feel special. The 
       energy there was just awesome. We ended up chilling on Pyramid of the Sun
       for a while, walked back down, went to Pyramid of the Moon, chilled a while,
       and then walked down the Avenue of the Dead (about a mile) towards Pyramid
       of the Feathered Serpent. At this point, we're pretty exhausted, and the sun
       was pretty brutal. We walked back towards the main entrance and found some
       lunch. Outside the main entrance they have probably a dozen different food
       vendors set up. You really can't go wrong w the street vendors down here.
       That's literally my favorite thing about Mexico. The food you buy from
       street vendors here is literally both the absolute best, and absolute
       cheapest food you can find on the entire fucking planet. I shit you not.
       I could live off Mexican street vendor tacos. There is no comparison. If
       you know me, you know I'm not a foodie. I could honestly care less about 
       food. When I'm hungry, I just want to be not hungry. Feed me whatever 
       replinishes my calorie stores. Down here, well, that's more than half the 
       reason I'm here. I can't articulate this enough. La comida aqui es la 
       mejor del todo mundo. I digress. We get back to the hotel and took a few
       hour siesta. We're both pretty burnt, but totally worth it. Woke up and 
       went to a taqueria down the street. Have I mentioned how awesome legit 
       Mexican food is? The second night we stayed at the hotel, there was staff,
       lights, other guests, a pretty significant difference from the first night.
       Woke up this morning, had breakfast, and walked to a bus station about a 
       half mile north of our hotel, and hopped on a bus back into Mexico City.
       The stop we got off was very close to the Airbnb I had booked, and the guy
       met us at the apartment I had rented. He was super nice, and this place is
       actually pretty great. About $120 USD for 5 nights. Holy shit I love Mexico. 
       So basically we've been chillin here ever since. Went out for food. Found 
       this little hole in the wall place. Have I mentioned how much legit Mexican
       food...well you get the idea. Been chillin, discussing business ideas, got
       this website back up and running, and here I am, typing all this out. Ricky
       is headed home tomorrow, and so I got 5 full days to tear up Mexico City by
       myself. Gonna be awesome. Stay tuned :)
       </p><br>
    <h2 class="even">Update 5/4/2017</h2>
    <p>I've been home for a few days now. The bus ride from Monterrey to Austin
       took a little over 11 hours. About 4 hours of that is just crossing the
       border. The line to border crossing is about a mile long and moves very
       slowly. The buses get to pull off to a separate location where everyone
       gets off the bus and sends their luggage thru an xray scanner and then
       shows their passports or visa to the border patrol. They didn't ask for 
       my visa on the way home, which was my whole issue when I flew home out of
       Canc√∫n. Plan is still to head back June 27th and head into Belize. Thanks
       for keeping up with me. It's been a wild journey so far.</p><br>
    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/28</h2>
    <p>It is hot in Mexico. So yesterday morning I woke up and for the first 
       time since I've been in Mexico I had some stomach issues. My best guess
       is that it was from some ice I had 2 nights ago. There's signs on every
       sink in this hotel that says the water is not potable. I assumed that 
       they wouldn't serve me ice from the tap, and maybe they didn't, but 
       that's my best guess as to what happened. Felt pretty weak all day, so I
       just spent the day window shopping and eating along Madero Avenue. It's 
       one of the major roads thru town and there's all kinds of cool shops and
       stuff. Nothing too exciting, but I just like being down here. Today I 
       attempted Cerro de la Silla. Note attempted. I left early this morning 
       when it was still cool, but I had to walk a mile to the metrorail, and
       the closest stop to the start of the hike was still 2 miles away. I 
       loaded my backpack with sandwiches and 3L of water, but by the time I got
       to the start of the trail it was already in the 90s. I hiked it for about
       an hour or so and was already down to about a liter of water left. Since
       I was sweating bullets and consuming water a lot faster than I 
       anticipated, I stopped after maybe an hour and a half and decided it was
       best to turn back. There was no one else on the trail, which led me to 
       think I was the only person stupid enough to even try it in this heat. By
       the time I made it back down I was already out of water. The trail was
       very well maintained and I saw all kinds of neat birds, squirrels, and
       even a boar. At the base of the trail there's a sign that tells you what
       to do in case you encounter un oso negro. It actually says on there
       don't take a selfie with it, lol, which is EXACTLY what I would do if I 
       encountered one. Got a pic of the sign in my dropbox. The other thing is
       that it's kinda hazy today, so even if I made it to the peak I don't 
       think the pics of the city would've come out that great. At some point,
       I'll convince someone to come down here in the winter with me and I'll 
       try it again. I'll bet it's really nice here in December. I probably 
       could have loaded up more water, but that just would've made my pack even
       heavier than it already was. Felt like the classic rocket science 
       problem. It takes a shitload of fuel to get a rocket to escape Earth's 
       gravity and/or get into orbit. But the fuel itself is heavy, so you find 
       yourself adding fuel, to carry the fuel. This problem compounds itself
       exponentially and before you know it you've got a rocket that's 95% fuel
       and 5% payload. Again, I digress. So about 7 miles and 6 tacos later, I'm
       back in my hotel. Siesta time. There's a few new pics added. Saw a car
       accident happen on Madero yesterday. Kinda surprised it took this long.
       People generally obey traffic lights, but it seems like stop signs are
       more of a suggestion. So if you ever find yourself driving or walking 
       around down here, just remember: when the light turns green it does not
       mean it is safe to cross the intersection. It only means it's legal to do
       so :-) Adi√≥s!</p><br>

    <h2 class="even">Update 4/26</h2>
    <p>Well the last 12 hours or so have sucked ass. I got zero sleep. Two 
       nights ago I passed right out from exhaustion and my all night bus ride
       to get down here. That and there was myself and 2 other guys in this 
       shared dorm room at the hostel. Last night it was me and 4 other guys.
       There is no AC in the room, and the body heat from 5 people really made
       the room rediculously hot. I got up to smoke about 1 in the morning, only
       to find they padlocked the front gate into the building. They only have 1
       key to this padlock and the owner has it on the backside of the property.
       Between the dorm room and the back end of the property there is a 
       kitchen. Suddenly I realized if the kitchen were to catch fire in the 
       night, we're totally fucked. So between that and me sweating all over the
       bed sheets to the point I can't lay on them anymore, I spent most of the 
       night out in the courtyard, where there is a wall I could jump over in
       case a fire broke out. Strange I know, but being in a foreign country the
       US govt declares dangerous does not scare me. Fire and car accidents 
       scare me. Statistically speaking, Americans getting murdered or kidnapped
       in Mexico is actually exceedingly rare. It's just that when it happens it
       is so widely reported. Over 30,000 Americans die in car accidents every 
       year. That's fucking scary. 3500 Americans die every year in house fires.
       For the several several years, about 100 Americans die each year in 
       Mexico (of the 6 million Americans that come here each year). I digress.
       So one of the guys staying at the hostel with me spoke English, so I 
       asked him to translate for me my concerns to the staff, and that I was 
       leaving and wanted a refund for the 4 nights I wouldn't be staying here.
       After about 20 minutes of back and forth with he and the staff, he says
       to me they're not going to do it, and they're being pricks about it too. 
       Apparently he had paid for one night (smart thing to do) and was going to
       pay for 2 more nights, but they jacked the price up on him. He pulled up
       a listing for a hostel down the street for the same price he'd paid for 
       the first night and they refused. So he left too and assured them they're
       getting 2 shitty reviews, to which they didn't seem to care. So fuck that
       place, La Casa del Barrio. Can't say I'm super surprised, considering it
       was literally the cheapest place in all of Monterrey. So that's about 
       $44USD I'll never see again. Not too bad, but still I'm super pissed at
       those assholes. If I knew better Spanish I'd research how to report these
       guys for not having a fire escape. I know it's Mexico and all, but in
       every other hotel here (even the shitty ones) there were always clearly 
       marked multiple exits that were unlocked at all times from the inside. I
       can't imagine Mexico doesn't have some sort of regulation regarding fire 
       escapes. So anyways, fuck those guys. I'm now in my own room at a hotel
       (not a hostel) I found for about $30USD a night. So considering the $66
       I paid for a week at the hostel, plus the $120 for the 4 nights here, I'm
       still under $200 for a week. Not too shaby. So it's about 2pm, and I'm 
       going to bed finally. The AC in here works great, the bed is very 
       comfortable, and I have the room to myself. No hiking or exploring today,
       just relaxing and getting some sleep. New plan is to wake up super early
       and head off to the mountains. Finally got a pic of the Polic√≠a. Kinda
       sucks because I had to zoom all the way in from across the street, but
       you get the idea. You fuck with those guys, you're gonna have a bad 
       time. Hasta ma√±ana!

    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/25</h2>
    <p>Went for a long walk this morning. It was about 6 miles by my Google 
       Earth measurements. First I set out to explore the Macroplaza which is 
       about a quarter mile from my hostel. It's pretty awesome. It's a really
       big park that has most of the official state buildings like the 
       courthouse, congress, and the capital building. Monterrey is the capital
       of the state of Nuevo Leon. Before I crossed the border last month, I was       unaware that Mexico is officially called Estados Unidos Mexicanos, which
       roughly translates to the United Mexican States. There's 31 states and
       one federal district (like we have 50 states and Washington D.C.). 
       Anyways, the Macroplaza is awesome. It's just a big park with sculptures,
       artisans selling random trinkety crap, and a bunch of people with these
       massage chairs setup where they'll give you a massage in the park. Kinda
       cool. I saw one guy paying the massage lady 20 pesos, which is like a
       dollar. Probably gets you like 5-10 min or something, but whatever. I'm
       not into massages, but can't deny how nifty and cheap that is. So after a
       long walk I decided to find some tacos. When I was here a few weeks ago
       I had the best barbacoa tacos I've ever had, so I set off to find that
       same place again. I went to la calle Liberdad, the street that I was sure
       it was on and started walking west. I went a mile and couldn't find it, 
       so I went up one street and walked the mile back towards the east where I
       came from. Couldn't find it. Disappointed I started back towards my 
       hostel. I decided I'd try east on Liberdad for a few blocks just in case
       it was a lot further down than I had remembered. Made it 1 block east 
       from where I started on Liberdad and there it was. Barbacoa tacos for 9 
       pesos a piece (a little less than 50 cents). The best part is that it's a
       lot closer to my hostel than I expected, like maybe 2/3 of a mile. So I'm
       going there every damn day. And for future reference, or anyone else who
       reads this and makes it down to Monterrey, it is the taqueria on la calle
       Liberdad between calles Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. You will not be 
       disappointed. Don't think it has a name, a lot of these places don't. So
       it's now 1pm. Decided to come back to my hostel and chill for the next 4
       to 5 hours, because in the middle of the day, it gets hot as hell, and 
       that's what got me sick last time. So I feel like I'm getting a little 
       better at this. Below is a pic of the capital, as well as the best $2
       lunch ever. Can anyone tell me what that green sauce is? I meant to ask
       but totally forgot when I went to pay. It's spicy as hell and DELICIOUS. 
       If it's something that's sold in the states I'm buying it and putting it
       on everything. Tonight when it cools off I'm going to explore downtown a
       little more, and tomorrow I'm going to get up early and head off to Cerro
       de la Silla. There's a lot more great pics of the Macroplaza in my 
       Dropbox, and I'll probably add more to it later tonight. Adi√≥s!</p><br>

    <h2 class="even">Update 4/24</h2>
    <p>Back in Monterrey. Made it to my hostel about 2 hours ago. I was able to
       sleep a little bit on the bus from Austin to Laredo, but afterwards nada.
       When you take a bus across the border they pull into this designated area
       where everyone gets off and you show them your passport and get a visa if
       needed. Then you put your luggage thru an xray machine and they herd you
       back onto the bus. The whole thing took almost 3 hours. Pretty different
       from when I just walked across the border last time. Anyways I'm pretty 
       tired. When I got off the bus my first mission was to find an ATM and get
       a metrorail ticket to get across town to my hostel. So unlike all other
       bus stations in Mexico, Greyhound stations don't have ATMs. So I go to 
       the nearest gas station, and their ATM is out of order. So I go to the 
       metrorail station and find an ATM. For whatever reason, it won't read my
       card. I walk back towards the bus station and go to the Pemex on the 
       other side. They have no ATM, unlike every other Pemex I went to in all
       of Mexico. So I go sit in the bus station to use their wifi to find more
       Oxxo and Pemex stations. Found another Pemex about a mile away. Luckily
       this one had one that works. So I had to walk back to the metrorail
       station where I was finally able to buy a ticket. The metrorail is pretty
       great. They come every 10 min or so and it took maybe 20 min to get all
       the way across town. My hostel is a quarter mile away from the last stop        and it's in a really nice part of town. If you step outside and walk to 
       the end of the street there's a pretty fantastic view of las monta√±as and
       Cerro de la Silla. Probably not gonna do any hiking tomorrow. Just gonna
       rest, wander, and eat tacos. Since I got back from the first trip, I've 
       been studying Spanish at least 8 hours everyday. I was home about 9 or 10       days before I came back, but WOW what a difference. It's kinda surreal. 
       I'm at the point where I can hear and recognize about 80% of the words in
       any given conversation. I can 'instantly' translate only about a third. 
       I studied enough grammar at this point that this time I can put actual
       sentences together, instead of just a noun or two. Still tho, hearing and
       immediately recognizing what is said is difficult. That's gonna take some
       time. Spanish sentence structure is a little screwy, and don't get me 
       started on pronouns. Lo, tu, ti, su, sus, etc... oh man I just don't get
       it yet. Either way I'm super impressed with myself. I've been studying
       Spanish intensely about 2 months now, and never would've guessed I'd be
       this far. I always figured gaining fluency in another language would be
       tricky, and it totally is. Especially considering I haven't thought about
       what a predicate is since 7th grade. Anyways, no plans for the rest of 
       the day but relax and eat tacos. I uploaded a few more pics, nothing 
       special. The pic below is of Topo Chico. If you've ever heard of that
       bottled mineral water by the same name, well this is the mountain it
       comes from. I read they grab the runoff from springs on the mountain 
       then purify it, bottle it, and sell it. Hasta luego!</p><br>

    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/23</h2>
    <p>So, I decided to go back to Mexico. I really miss it, I've been studying
       Spanish constantly since I got back, and I really miss the food. After
       doing some research I booked round trip Greyhound tickets Austin to 
       Monterrey for $46 and 6 nights in a hostel for about $11 a night. I 
       couldn't help myself. I had to come back to one of my favorite cities
       for a week. Bus leaves at 1:40am so I'll be in Monterrey about 10am
       Monday morning. I'll probably update the site every 2 or 3 days, but I
       plan to do some hiking up the local mountains, which should yield some
       pretty awesome pics.</p><br>
    <h2 class="even">Update 4/16</h2>
    <p>June 27th, 2017 (a little more than 10 weeks from now) I'm flying back
       into Canc√∫n, bussing into Belize, and continuing right where I left off.
       This gives me 10 weeks of intense Spanish prep, as well as some actual 
       planning for this trip now that I actually have an idea of what I'm 
       getting myself into. I plan to spend about a week in each of the 7 
       Central American countries and probably 1.5-2 weeks each in Costa Rica 
       and Panama. All on a minimal budget that includes campsites, hostels, and
       couchsurfing. The website will probably change a little between now and 
       when I leave, as I learn a little more and experiment with different 
       layouts.</p><br> 
    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/15</h2>
    <p>Back in Tyler, TX as of yesterday. Long story short, heat exhaustion in
       Tulum and a very cheap flight home. Here to regroup, get a better handle
       on Spanish, and I'm planning my trip back to Central America. No date
       picked yet, but I'll post here and probably let everyone know anyhow.
       Great pics from Tulum. Just started to feel very sick after a day of 
       walking in the heat, it was the 4th time I'd overdone it, so I felt it 
       best to come home and recover a while. I've lost 10lbs, which is not good
       for my size. I'm fine, more or less recovered at this point. Thanks for
       reading and keeping up with me. I love you all :-)</p><br>

    <h2 class="even">Update 4/11</h2>
    <p>Today was Chich√©n Itz√°!! Ok so unlike Teotihuac√°n, where I loved every
       second of it, Chich√©n Itz√° definitely has some pros and cons. Cons: It is
       definitely a tourist trap. Thousands of people, hundreds of pushy vendors
       literally all selling the same trinkets and such, and the line to buy a
       ticket to get in was an hour long. At Teotihuac√°n there was no line and I
       felt like I had the place to myself. And maybe like a half dozen vendors.
       Honestly what did I expect? Most people showed up on these fancy tour
       buses from Canc√∫n or a cruise or something, and let's face it, not many
       people vacation to Mexico City. Ok pros: it's actually pretty sweet. El
       Castillo is the main building everyone thinks of regarding Chich√©n Itz√°
       but it's actually just the centerpiece to a pretty big ancient city. I
       walked around out there for a few hours and kept being surprised when I
       found something new. I've got lots of pics and I want to say I found at
       least 90% of what's out there, but I could be wrong. It was 95 degrees so
       at the end of it I was exhausted and starving. At the visitors center
       they have this fancy restaurant and I didn't want any snack food crap so
       I figured, whatever, I'll splurge on this meal. Ordered this giant piece
       of fajita meat that came with chicken enchiladas, beans, a slab of cheese
       and homemade lemonade. Out here in the Yucat√°n they accept American 
       currency as well, so it gave me a chance to use some I came with. 
       Expecting a fancy ass meal like this to be around $30 or so, imagine my
       shock at $16. Hot damn I love Mexico. Afterwards I hopped on a bus for
       Tulum, which is where I'm at now. Found a decent hotel. My plan is to
       wake up and go see the ruins here, but first I'm going to buy a bus 
       ticket for Belize! The plan is to see the ruins in the morning and bus it
       in the evening into Belize, but we'll see if the bus schedules work out
       that way. If not I may just try and hitch a ride south. We'll see. 
       Either way my time in Mexico is coming to an end. It was more amazing
       than I ever expected. Aside from a couple asshole cops in Mexico City, I
       didn't really have any negative experiences here. Even the cop thing was
       extremely tame compared to what cops in the US have put me through. Yeah
       me and cops, we go way back. Anyways, yesterday I didn't really do much.
       Walked around Canc√∫n a little more. Had 2 of the best tamales I've ever
       had for like 30 pesos (around $1.80). The kid I bought them from couldn't
       have been more than 11. That actually bothers me a little. I've seen boys
       and girls 10 or younger standing on the same corner selling food or 
       trinkets or whatever for HOURS. Definitely a little depressing. I gotta 
       admit tho, the absolute best AND cheapest food you will find down here is
       from street vendors. They got their shit down, and with zero overhead
       they pass the savings on to you! So hells yeah for Mexico. Gonna miss it.
       Coming back for sure. If any of you wanna make a weekend trip down to 
       Monterrey, I'm so down. Greyhound has a daily trip from Austin to 
       Monterrey and back. No reason not to. Don't listen to the American fear
       porn. They want you to think the rest of the world is this dark dangerous
       place where everyone hates Americans because we're free or something.
       That's crap. It's war propaganda. Divide and conquer. There's criminals
       in every single country, but everyday people are just like everyday 
       people in the US. Everyone wants to be happy. Everyone wants what's best
       for their kids. Everyone is curious about the world, so go explore it!
       Ok I'm done for the night. I'm just gonna miss Mexico so damn much. I 
       love you all :-)</p><br>

    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/9 afternoon</h2>
    <p>Alright so my sleep schedule is totally fucked, but whatever. I'm in 
       tropical paradise, the cost of living is like $30USD/day (shit hotel), 
       and I couldn't be happier. Didn't sleep at all last night, went for a 
       stroll along the beach this morning and wasn't disappointed. A few pics 
       and a vid, check'em out. If there wasn't a beautiful young girl at home 
       awaiting my return, I honestly probably wouldn't (seriously miss you like
       crazy Vanna:). Not making any short-term plans; the bus rides pissed me 
       off. Don't I deserve this? Tranny hookers and aggressive cabbies/street 
       vendors aside, I'm fucking loving this place. "No gracias" is my go-to
       phrase. My stress level is now at like -5 or something. Or is that +5
       bliss? Whatever, this place is the shit. BTW sorry for my foul language.
       If you don't know me that well, I'm a bit of a character. Shocker right?
       Hitchhiking and busing thru Mexico, who fucking does that?! This guy. 
       Again, I love you all, your WhatsApp texts make me smile; keep'em
       coming. Nap time and we'll see what the next day brings. Sorry the days
       aren't as adventurous as the first few, but I'm literally trying to take
       it easy.</p><br>

    <h2 class="even">Update 4/9 middle of the night</h2>
    <p>Alright it's 4 in the morning but this was totally worthy of a post. I 
       slept about 9 hours this afternoon once I got to a hotel, so naturally
       I'm having a bit of trouble sleeping. I walk to the store for a pack of
       cigs. It's down the street. I'm smoking my last one before I walk 
       inside. This OBVIOUS tranny walks up to me and grabs my dick. "You want
       fuck, you want suck? I make you feel real good Americano." LOL "No 
       gracias, no gracias!", I keep saying. I guess the awkward smile led 
       her/him/it on cause she wouldn't let go. Literally had to grab her arm 
       and remove it from my crotch. I walk inside the store. Two employees and
       about 4 customers are laughing their asses off, apparently seeing this
       whole debacle. OMG Canc√∫n. WTF?! Gonna be an interesting few days...</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/8</h2>
    <p>Ok so 18 hours on the bus. Define misery. Just got to a hotel. Haven't
       slept in a while. Gonna chill here in Canc√∫n a few days. No new pics yet.
       Gonna sleep as long as I can. Should have lots more pics tomorrow night.
       Thought the waving flag was a nice touch :)
    </p><br>
    <h2 class="even">Update 4/7 afternoon</h2>
    <p>I got about 5 hours sleep. Woke up and decided to bite the bullet and 
       take the bus all the way out to Canc√∫n. Sitting here at the bus station
       currently. Gonna be a 15 hour bus ride. Gonna stay in Canc√∫n for at least
       a couple days and use it as my final base of operations here in Mexico.
       I'll take a day trip out to Chich√©n Itz√°, spend a day at the ruins in 
       Canc√∫n, and I'll hit up Tulum on my way south into Belize. I'm definitely
       pretty exhausted at this point. These bus rides are pretty draining
       but it's the cheapest and quickest way for me to cover the distance I 
       need to get to where I want to go. I'm guessing I'll be in Mexico another
       3-4 days, and then Part 2 of my adventure begins when I hit Central 
       America! Saw a couple iguanas on my walk to the bus station this morning
       but I was too slow with the camera. I'm sure I'll see more. I'll be in 
       Canc√∫n about 930am tomorrow and the plan is to get a hotel, do some much
       needed laundry, and then sleep for 12 hours if I can. No new pics yet.
       However I'm sure that'll change when I get to Canc√∫n. Adi√≥s!
    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/7 morning</h2>
    <p>Ever been on a bus for 11 hours? Well it sucks. Woke up yesterday in 
       Oaxaca and bought a bus ticket for Coatzacoalcos. Can you pronounce that?
       Me neither. Basically showed a map to the ticket clerk and said "Aqu√≠!"
       Eleven hours later, here we are. The bus station here is pretty nice,
       but being dropped off at 330 in the morning left me wondering whether I
       should sleep at the bus station to avoid paying for a night for 7 hours.
       Decided to have a taxi drive me a couple miles into town to the cheapest
       hotel I could find. It was in the middle of town and at 4 in the morning,
       it's a freakin ghost town. Cabbie drops me off and zooms off. I walk 
       into the hotel and immediately the guy starts shaking his head no, "No
       tengo" was all I got. OK, so now I'm in the middle of this town at 4 in
       the morning. Pull up the GPS, nearest hotel is a mile. Long story short,
       I spent an hour walking around and hit up 3 hotels before I found one 
       with room. So here we are. Got 6.5 hours til checkout and for some reason
       I'm not really tired. Before it got dark the ride today was absolutely
       beautiful. I got some pretty great pics out the window. Oaxaca is like
       the last city in Mexico that's in the desert region. From here to the
       Yucat√°n it's green and lots of palm trees and humid. I like it. I'm
       working my way towards Merida. That's the closest city to the remaining
       ruins I want to see here in Mexico. After a night in Merida I'll hit up
       Chich√©n Itz√° on my way into Canc√∫n. There's ruins there too, so I'll 
       see if I can find a cheap hotel there, and then I'll hit up Tulum on my
       way down into Belize. I think I can hit all that up in about 4-5 days,
       but the bus ride from here to Merida is gonna be like another 11 hours,
       maybe more. I could be wrong. Part of the reason the ride today took so
       long is because most of the trip was on this winding mountain road. We
       were going probably about 45mph. Looks like it's mostly highway from here
       to Merida, but still it's a long freakin ways. Turns out Mexico is big. 
       Takes a while to get places. Hope you all enjoy the pics. Hit me up on
       WhatsApp whenever.</p><br><br>

    <h2 class="even">Update 4/5 evening</h2>
    <p>So today has been a pretty lazy day for me, so I figured I'd upgrade the
       site a little bit with some pics and share a few more reflections on my
       time here in Mexico. I've been here a week now. If my stress level on 
       day one was a 10, I'm now down to about a 2. My fears of being randomly
       kidnapped or murdered by cartel or federalies has diminished to zero. 
       Obviously I'm still taking regular precautions. Don't walk around late
       at night. If an area gives me a bad vibe, I leave. And get this, only 1
       homeless person has asked me for change. One! Honestly, there's a 
       shitload more homeless people walking the streets in the US than I've 
       seen in any city I've been to down here. I'm trying not to be surprised
       by things like this. I've known for years American media is horseshit.
       If there's one thing I've learned so far it's that if you let mainstream
       media or Hollywood movies dictate your worldview regarding any particular
       culture or country, you are most likely incredibly misinformed. Fear 
       sells. OK I'm done with that little rant.<br>Rant number 2. My only
       real issue with Mexico is their electrical infrastructure. As someone
       who does electrical work and is very familiar with electrical code, well
       I can't walk a single block without seeing code violations. When wires
       come off the transformers and go to the weather head and down into the
       meter, I've seen wires twisted together with no wire nuts/tape or 
       anything, meters with the covers completely removed, and all other sorts
       of uncovered electrical boxes. I just keep thinking some drunk dumbass
       could stumble right into that and game over. The meters with no covers
       is exceptionally dangerous because the entire current load for buildings
       runs thru those 2 wires. You can be shocked with millions of volts or 
       more from a taser, cattle prod, or electric fence because there is 
       essentially zero current that runs thru them. It's just high voltage. It
       will stop you dead in your tracks but it's non-lethal because of the 
       lack of current. If you touch 2 bare wires or bus bars on one of these
       uncovered meters, we're talking potentially hundreds of amps. And get 
       this, 1 amp will kill you. Get your electrical shit together Mexico.<br>
       OK rant 3. Street performers. This is actually pretty cool. I first saw
       this in Monterrey and then everywhere in Mexico City. At stop lights
       people will stand in the middle of the street and juggle, breakdance,
       or do that fire-breathing stuff with a torch and everclear. When the
       light turns green they jump to the lines between the lanes and collect
       money from people as they pass by. This is what impresses me the most:
       people ALWAYS stop and give them change. The light will be green but cars
       will slow down, sometimes to a complete stop, and hand them change out 
       the window. At any given traffic light if there's time for a dozen cars
       to make it thru, usually only 6 will make it because of the people 
       stopping to give change to the performers. Nobody honks, cusses, or 
       anything at them. It's just part of everyday life if you drive around  
       here. I always just laugh to myself about how this would not fly in the
       US. If you hesitate or hold up a traffic light for like 2 seconds in the
       US, you're gonna hear about it from cars around you. I know how to 
       juggle, so I figured if I get mugged or lose my backpack, phone, and 
       everything I can do this for water/food money til I figure out how to 
       contact home. Always good to have a worst-case scenario plan :-)<br>
       Dinner time for me. And oh man, legit Mexican kicks ass. Thank God I love
       spice. I don't think they know how to cook it without.
    </p><br>
    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/5</h2>
    <p>Yesterday morning was amazing. The hotel I stayed at in Teotihuac√°n was
       really nice and the breakfast was even better. Afterwards I spent around
       3 hours at the pyramid complex. It was truly amazing. Of all the tourist
       type places I've ever been to, this was my absolute favorite. The size of
       the 2 pyramids is astounding, not to mention the surrounding architecture
       of the city on the Avenue of the Dead. I've got lots of pics and a few
       vids in my dropbox. I decided I wanted to explore the town some before I
       headed back into Mexico City. At this point, I'm anxious to get out to 
       the Yucat√°n so I got a bus ticket for Oaxaca. Expecting about a 6 hour
       drive, we made several stops and the traffic in Mexico City is insane, so
       it ended up being about a 9 hour drive. That was pretty exhausting. Got
       to Oaxaca about 130 in the morning last night and got a cheap hotel 
       across the street from the bus station. I got plenty of sleep last night
       but I'm still feeling exhausted, so I'm going to spend another day here
       in Oaxaca. No real plan as of yet, just to find some food and mail home
       this blanket I bought at Teotihuac√°n (pic of it in dropbox). Needed 
       something to remember my new favorite place on Earth. I'm sure I'll be 
       back someday when I find someone as crazy as me willing to fly into
       Mexico City to go check them out. Honestly if I could do yesterday over
       again, I would've spent more time at the complex and stayed an extra 
       night out there, and just gotten up early to head to Oaxaca. Oh well,
       this whole trip has been a learning experience and I'm definitely no 
       expert on this solo international travel stuff...yet. Feeling super lazy
       today, and I have no real plan for the next few days, so when I get all
       that figured out I'll post it here. Hope you enjoy the pics and vids
       from yesterday. It was definitely the highlight of my trip thus far.</p>

    <h2 class="even">Update 4/3</h2>
    <p>So once upon a time in Mexico...I woke up in San Luis Potos√≠ and headed
       for the bus station. When you're trying to get 400km in a day, and bus
       tickets are like 8 bucks, well that doesn't take a genius. So off to 
       Mexico City. I haven't seen anything like Mexico City since Cairo. It's
       huge, it's a maze, everything is painted in these bright strange colors,
       just take a look at the photos. Sorry they're all from out of a bus 
       window, but you get the idea. So I get off the bus at the station and 
       I'm in a daze. Thousands of people, no clue which way is the exit, so I
       decide to spark up a cigarrette (I wanted to quit on this trip, but $2
       a pack?!) and tried to get my bearings. I'm standing there maybe 45 
       seconds and out of thousands of people these 2 fucking cops walk right
       up to me. Thankfully, they look like normal cops, and not those special
       forces looking guys I saw back in Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. They start
       asking me something and I just respond with "habla ingles?" To which I 
       get no response and they motion for me to remove my backpack and put it
       on the ground in front of me. One starts digging thru it, the other asks
       for my ID. "Drogas?" one asked. "No" I replied. "Armas?" Again I shook 
       my head no. I decided to pull my Swiss Army knife out of my pocket and 
       showed him. He looked unimpressed and I pointed to the taser I have in 
       the mesh pocket on the side of my bag. He takes a look at it, and the 
       other cop decides to give up. There's like 4 main zippers on my backpack
       and he gave up after digging thru the first 2 after finding only 
       my clothes and some charging cables for my phone and laptop. I mean, I 
       kinda get it. I was sticking out like a sore thumb. Only white guy there
       with a bigger backpack than anyone else. I guess they were satisfied
       after seeing it's not stuffed to the brim with coke or something. 
       That and I was as cooperative as I could've been. The cop handed me my
       ID and they just walked off. OK, so time to get the fuck out of here, 
       I'm thinking. Find the entrance to the bus station. You know that scene
       from Men in Black where Will Smith walks into the MIB headquarters for 
       the first time, and it's like this intergalactic waystation? That's 
       what I felt like. I wish I got pics of this place but I was still so 
       shook up over the cop thing I just wanted to keep moving. I walk outside
       the bus station, still no real plan and realize if I take one step into
       this maze of a city, I'm getting lost, GPS or no. Ok, back into the bus
       station! I find a terminal that says Teotihuac√°n, exactly where I want 
       to go. Two dollars and a bus leaving in 5 minutes. Awesome! Drops me off
       on the north end of the pyramid complex. The town of Teotihuac√°n is so
       cool. Imagine Santa Fe, but like 100 times better. All kinds of shops,
       not too crowded, and everything is decked out in Mayan shit. It's really
       cool. I walked down to the pyramid complex entrance about 630, but they
       were closed for the evening. So I walked back to the hotel, ate some 
       food, went to my room and here we are. Tomorrow is going to kick so much
       ass. Freaking cannot wait to get to those pyramids!!!</p><br>

    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/2</h2>
    <p>Today was a long bus ride. Woke up in Linares. The bus station was about
       a mile walk from the hotel. I caught a bus to the town of Matehuala, 
       which was about 6 hours away, where I switched buses and rode another 2
       hours or so down to the town of San Luis Potos√≠. SLP is a big city. 
       Honestly if everything wasn't in spanish, you'd think it was McAllen or
       Brownsville or something. The best part of the ride today was the first
       hour outside Linares. We took this winding road thru the mountains, the
       same range that extends all the way up to Monterrey. After that it was
       desert. Honestly the scenery reminded me a lot of the trip Ricky and I 
       took to the Grand Canyon a few years back. A lot of it looked like New
       Mexico and a lot of it looked like Arizona. It's that desert look with
       sparse hills/mountains with all types of cacti and other desert plants.
       I took a lot of pics out the bus window and they're uploaded to my
       dropbox. When I got to SLP there were about 6 hotels within walking
       distance of the bus station. At this point I'm kinda anxious to get out
       to the Mayan ruins. Tomorrow I'm going to bus it to Mexico City. It's 
       gonna be another long bus ride, but I feel like it would take me days 
       hitchhike down there. My only goal for Mexico City is to see 
       Teotihuac√°n. After that I'll probably bus it to Oaxaca, tool around for
       a day, and then bus it out to the Yucat√°n. Then the fun really begins.
       Mayan ruins, pristine beaches, tropical weather, jungles, howler monkeys.
       Oh man it's gonna kick ass.</p><br>

    <h2 class="even">Update 4/1 morning</h2>
    <p>Well I woke up feeling pretty weird. With the 10 miles of walking in the
       Mexican sol, I think I overdid it a little yesterday. I'm worried if I
       press on today I'll just make myself sick. So I paid for another night 
       in this nice hotel here in Linares where I'm gonna sleep some more and
       do some planning for the next few days. Time for a siesta but hit me up
       on WhatsApp anytime. Pic is from rooftop of Linares hotel.</p><br>

    <h2 class="odd">Update 3/31 evening</h2>
    <p>Again, what a day. After the interview I wandered thru Monterrey. I 
       uploaded a map of my route thru the city. It was 8.5 miles before the 
       gas station where I got my first ride. Nice guy, gave me a ride about 10
       miles south. Let me out at an Oxxo (gas stations that are everywhere 
       here) and the first truck I asked gave me a ride into Santiago, about 
       another 20-30 miles south. There were 3 guys and me in this truck, and
       I couldn't understand any of them. Like at all. They were absolutely
       hilarious. They offered me a cerveza and I showed them my bottle of 
       water. They laughed and I'm pretty sure I heard pinche cabr√≥n. They
       were speaking that rapid fire espa√±ol and literally every sentence I 
       heard chinga/chingada. They kept asking me questions and when I 
       responded with 'no se' they just kept laughing at me. Honestly I'm 
       pretty sure the whole situation would have made a lot of people 
       uncomfortable, but I thought it was awesome. I snuck a pic from
       the backseat, it's the one with the older fellow driving. They let me 
       out at an Oxxo in Santiago, where I walked a couple more hours and had
       the best (and cheapest) barbacoa tacos I've ever had. I ended up at
       a Pemex (the other major gas station here) which is where I met Ezekial.
       This guy was awesome. He spoke literally no english, but spoke real slow
       for me and miraculously I feel like I had pretty great conversation with
       him. He drove me down to Linares, which is where I'm at now. When we got
       to town, he drove me around a little bit and we ended up at a barber 
       shop (literally on this guy's front porch, great pic of it in dropbox) 
       where I waited and chatted while he got his hair cut. After he was done
       he drove me to the hotel I'm at now. He said a prayer for me and asked
       God to protect me on my journey. It's been things like this that have me
       somewhat overwhelmed and emotional. I'm not na√≠ve. I know what I'm doing
       is kinda crazy and relatively dangerous. I've put my faith in the 
       everyday people of a country I know nothing about, and it's been paying
       dividends out the ass. I can't explain it, it's just amazing. I'll never
       look at Mexico the same again. The war with the narcos/cartels is 
       definitely very real. All the locals talk about it. There's definitely a
       horrible situation going on down here with extreme violence, but I fear
       the American media has hyped the situation up so much that most people
       would never even imagine that the overwhelming majority of the Mexican 
       population are wonderful, friendly, generous people. The Polizia look
       mean as fuck. They drive around in these tricked out trucks with this
       gate type thing they stand on in the back with machine gun mounts. Mostly       M-16s, but in Nuevo Laredo I saw one sporting a .50 cal. They're decked
       out head to toe in Kevlar and wear fucking ski masks so all you see is
       their eyes. This morning when I was walking thru Monterrey, I rounded a 
       corner in a barrio I was a little nervous about, and found myself 
       immediately face-to-face with 2 of these guys holding M-16s. They either
       saw my hesitation or my eyes widen, cause they both gave me a gentle nod
       and I just kept walking. Honestly it made me feel a little better. 
       Considering these guys are armed to the fucking teeth, I get the feeling
       dicking with some gringo backpacker is super low on their priority list.
       Well that's probably enough for tonight. Ezekial convinced me to take a
       bus from Linares to San Luis Potos√≠. Apparently it's super beautiful and
       all the guys at the barber shop were talking about how much safer it is
       there, especially considering what I'm doing. So who am I to argue with 
       the locals? Check the dropbox link, got a couple dozen or so more pics 
       added. The bus ride will be pretty long tomorrow, so the day will
       probably be pretty tame by comparison. I love you all. Thanks for reading
       and chatting with me on WhatsApp. Makes me feel not so far from home.</p>

    <p>Interview went fantastic. Only thing is they're really wanting to fill
       this position as soon as possible, so I told them if they really wanted
       to move forward, I would come home April 15th. So I'm going to be 
       checking my email to see what's next. Currently packing my bag and about
       to head towards the highway to hitch a ride south.</p><br>

    <h2 class="odd">Update 3/30</h2>
    <p>Well holy hell what a couple days it's been. Crossed the Rio Grande into        Nuevo Laredo yesterday morning about 630am. Walked about 5-7 miles thru
       the city and was able to hitch a ride from a trucker headed to Monterrey.       Finding free wifi down here is tricky. None of the usual shops have it,
       and even after purchasing a Telcel SIM card with data, it works but the 
       coverage is spotty even in the middle of the city. I ended up getting a 
       hotel for the night and was able to connect to their internet. Since then       I've upgraded my Verizon service to global. Think that should work better       moving forward. Anyhow, I woke up today exhausted and slightly sunburned.       Been walking about the city and eating random food from street vendors,         which are literally on every corner here. My spanish sucks, but I know 
       enough to get by. Started to hear it a little better too. I'm staying in        the same hotel again tonight, because I need reliable internet for a 
       Skype interview I have with a company back in Austin tomorrow morning.
       Tomorrow after the interview I'll be headed south toward San Luis Potosi.       Not sure if I'll make it that far, but that's the plan. As far 
       as safety and everything, I never really felt unsafe anywhere, even the
       border town. The people here are very friendly, and as soon as I start 
       speaking my shit spanish, many reply with shit english and we make it
       work from there. It's been a bit stressful at times, mostly because of
       the language barrier, but the experience of everything so far is totally
       making it worth it. </p><br>
