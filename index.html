    <h2 class="odd">Update 3/31 evening</h2>
    <p>Again, what a day. After the interview I wandered thru Monterrey. I 
       uploaded a map of my route thru the city. It was 8.5 miles before the 
       gas station where I got my first ride. Nice guy, gave me a ride about 10
       miles south. Let me out at an Oxxo (gas stations that are everywhere 
       here) and the first truck I asked gave me a ride into Santiago, about 
       another 20-30 miles south. There were 3 guys and me in this truck, and
       I couldn't understand any of them. Like at all. They were absolutely
       hilarious. They offered me a cerveza and I showed them my bottle of 
       water. They laughed and I'm pretty sure I heard pinche cabrón. They
       were speaking that rapid fire español and literally every sentence I 
       heard chinga/chingada. They kept asking me questions and when I 
       responded with 'no se' they just kept laughing at me. Honestly I'm 
       pretty sure the whole situation would have made a lot of people 
       uncomfortable, but I thought it was awesome. I snuck a pic from
       the backseat, it's the one with the older fellow driving. They let me 
       out at an Oxxo in Santiago, where I walked a couple more hours and had
       the best (and cheapest) barbacoa tacos I've ever had. I ended up at
       a Pemex (the other major gas station here) which is where I met Ezekial.
       This guy was awesome. He spoke literally no english, but spoke real slow
       for me and miraculously I feel like I had pretty great conversation with
       him. He drove me down to Linares, which is where I'm at now. When we got
       to town, he drove me around a little bit and we ended up at a barber 
       shop (literally on this guy's front porch, great pic of it in dropbox) 
       where I waited and chatted while he got his hair cut. After he was done
       he drove me to the hotel I'm at now. He said a prayer for me and asked
       God to protect me on my journey. It's been things like this that have me
       somewhat overwhelmed and emotional. I'm not naíve. I know what I'm doing
       is kinda crazy and relatively dangerous. I've put my faith in the 
       everyday people of a country I know nothing about, and it's been paying
       dividends out the ass. I can't explain it, it's just amazing. I'll never
       look at Mexico the same again. The war with the narcos/cartels is 
       definitely very real. All the locals talk about it. There's definitely a
       horrible situation going on down here with extreme violence, but I fear
       the American media has hyped the situation up so much that most people
       would never even imagine that the overwhelming majority of the Mexican 
       population are wonderful, friendly, generous people. The Polizia look
       mean as fuck. They drive around in these tricked out trucks with this
       gate type thing they stand on in the back with machine gun mounts. Mostly       M-16s, but in Nuevo Laredo I saw one sporting a .50 cal. They're decked
       out head to toe in Kevlar and wear fucking ski masks so all you see is
       their eyes. This morning when I was walking thru Monterrey, I rounded a 
       corner in a barrio I was a little nervous about, and found myself 
       immediately face-to-face with 2 of these guys holding M-16s. They either
       saw my hesitation or my eyes widen, cause they both gave me a gentle nod
       and I just kept walking. Honestly it made me feel a little better. 
       Considering these guys are armed to the fucking teeth, I get the feeling
       dicking with some gringo backpacker is super low on their priority list.
       Well that's probably enough for tonight. Ezekial convinced me to take a
       bus from Linares to San Luis Potosí. Apparently it's super beautiful and
       all the guys at the barber shop were talking about how much safer it is
       there, especially considering what I'm doing. So who am I to argue with 
       the locals? Check the dropbox link, got a couple dozen or so more pics 
       added. The bus ride will be pretty long tomorrow, so the day will
       probably be pretty tame by comparison. I love you all. Thanks for reading
       and chatting with me on WhatsApp. Makes me feel not so far from home.</p>

    <h2 class="even">Update 3/31</h2>
    <p>Interview went fantastic. Only thing is they're really wanting to fill
       this position as soon as possible, so I told them if they really wanted
       to move forward, I would come home April 15th. So I'm going to be 
       checking my email to see what's next. Currently packing my bag and about
       to head towards the highway to hitch a ride south.</p><br>

    <h2 class="odd">Update 3/30</h2>
    <p>Well holy hell what a couple days it's been. Crossed the Rio Grande into        Nuevo Laredo yesterday morning about 630am. Walked about 5-7 miles thru
       the city and was able to hitch a ride from a trucker headed to Monterrey.       Finding free wifi down here is tricky. None of the usual shops have it,
       and even after purchasing a Telcel SIM card with data, it works but the 
       coverage is spotty even in the middle of the city. I ended up getting a 
       hotel for the night and was able to connect to their internet. Since then       I've upgraded my Verizon service to global. Think that should work better       moving forward. Anyhow, I woke up today exhausted and slightly sunburned.       Been walking about the city and eating random food from street vendors,         which are literally on every corner here. My spanish sucks, but I know 
       enough to get by. Started to hear it a little better too. I'm staying in        the same hotel again tonight, because I need reliable internet for a 
       Skype interview I have with a company back in Austin tomorrow morning.
       Tomorrow after the interview I'll be headed south toward San Luis Potosi.       Not sure if I'll make it that far, but that's the plan. As far 
       as safety and everything, I never really felt unsafe anywhere, even the
       border town. The people here are very friendly, and as soon as I start 
       speaking my shit spanish, many reply with shit english and we make it
       work from there. It's been a bit stressful at times, mostly because of
       the language barrier, but the experience of everything so far is totally
       making it worth it. </p><br>
    <h2 class="even">Update 3/28</h2>
    <p>Drove to Austin from Waco last night. Headed to the Greyhound station
       shortly. Will be in Nuevo Laredo by 630am 3/29 and will be staying in
       the city of Monterrey tonight. If all goes to plan.</p><br>
    <h2 class="odd">Update 3/23</h2>
    <p>Scheduled to leave Tyler, TX on Monday 3/27. Will arive in Mexico at
       Nuevo Laredo early Wednesday morning 3/29.</p><br>
