    <h2 class="odd">Update 3/30</h2>
    <p>Well holy hell what a couple days it's been. Crossed the Rio Grande into        Nuevo Laredo yesterday morning about 630am. Walked about 5-7 miles thru
       the city and was able to hitch a ride from a trucker headed to Monterrey.       Finding free wifi down here is tricky. None of the usual shops have it,
       and even after purchasing a Telcel SIM card with data, it works but the 
       coverage is spotty even in the middle of the city. I ended up getting a 
       hotel for the night and was able to connect to their internet. Since then       I've upgraded my Verizon service to global. Think that should work better       moving forward. Anyhow, I woke up today exhausted and slightly sunburned.       Been walking about the city and eating random food from street vendors,         which are literally on every corner here. My spanish sucks, but I know 
       enough to get by. Started to hear it a little better too. I'm staying in        the same hotel again tonight, because I need reliable internet for a 
       Skype interview I have with a company back in Austin tomorrow morning.
       Tomorrow after the interview I'll be headed south toward San Luis Potosi.       Not sure if I'll make it that far, but that's the plan. As far 
       as safety and everything, I never really felt unsafe anywhere, even the
       border town. The people here are very friendly, and as soon as I start 
       speaking my shit spanish, many reply with shit english and we make it
       work from there. It's been a bit stressful at times, mostly because of
       the language barrier, but the experience of everything so far is totally
       making it worth it. </p><br>
    <h2 class="even">Update 3/28</h2>

       shortly. Will be in Nuevo Laredo by 630am 3/29 and will be staying in
       the city of Monterrey tonight. If all goes to plan.</p><br>
