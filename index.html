    <h2 class="even">Update 4/5 evening</h2>
    <p>So today has been a pretty lazy day for me, so I figured I'd upgrade the
       site a little bit with some pics and share a few more reflections on my
       time here in Mexico. I've been here a week now. If my stress level on 
       day one was a 10, I'm now down to about a 2. My fears of being randomly
       kidnapped or murdered by cartel or federalies has diminished to zero. 
       Obviously I'm still taking regular precautions. Don't walk around late
       at night. If an area gives me a bad vibe, I leave. And get this, only 1
       homeless person has asked me for change. One! Honestly, there's a 
       shitload more homeless people walking the streets in the US than I've 
       seen in any city I've been to down here. I'm trying not to be surprised
       by things like this. I've known for years American media is horseshit.
       If there's one thing I've learned so far it's that if you let mainstream
       media or Hollywood movies dictate your worldview regarding any particular
       culture or country, you are most likely incredibly misinformed. Fear 
       sells. OK I'm done with that little rant.<br>Rant number 2. My only
       real issue with Mexico is their electrical infrastructure. As someone
       who does electrical work and is very familiar with electrical code, well
       I can't walk a single block without seeing code violations. When wires
       come off the transformers and go to the weather head and down into the
       meter, I've seen wires twisted together with no wire nuts/tape or 
       anything, meters with the covers completely removed, and all other sorts
       of uncovered electrical boxes. I just keep thinking some drunk dumbass
       could stumble right into that and game over. The meters with no covers
       is exceptionally dangerous because the entire current load for buildings
       runs thru those 2 wires. You can be shocked with millions of volts or 
       more from a taser, cattle prod, or electric fence because there is 
       essentially zero current that runs thru them. It's just high voltage. It
       will stop you dead in your tracks but it's non-lethal because of the 
       lack of current. If you touch 2 bare wires or bus bars on one of these
       uncovered meters, we're talking potentially hundreds of amps. And get 
       this, 1 amp will kill you. Get your electrical shit together Mexico.<br>
       OK rant 3. Street performers. This is actually pretty cool. I first saw
       this in Monterrey and then everywhere in Mexico City. At stop lights
       people will stand in the middle of the street and juggle, breakdance,
       or do that fire-breathing stuff with a torch and everclear. When the
       light turns green they jump to the lines between the lanes and collect
       money from people as they pass by. This is what impresses me the most:
       people ALWAYS stop and give them change. The light will be green but cars
       will slow down, sometimes to a complete stop, and hand them change out 
       the window. At any given traffic light if there's time for a dozen cars
       to make it thru, usually only 6 will make it because of the people 
       stopping to give change to the performers. Nobody honks, cusses, or 
       anything at them. It's just part of everyday life if you drive around  
       here. I always just laugh to myself about how this would not fly in the
       US. If you hesitate or hold up a traffic light for like 2 seconds in the
       US, you're gonna hear about it from cars around you. I know how to 
       juggle, so I figured if I get mugged or lose my backpack, phone, and 
       everything I can do this for water/food money til I figure out how to 
       contact home. Always good to have a worst-case scenario plan :-)<br>
       Dinner time for me. And oh man, legit Mexican kicks ass. Thank God I love
       spice. I don't think they know how to cook it without.
    </p><br>
    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/5</h2>
    <p>Yesterday morning was amazing. The hotel I stayed at in Teotihuacán was
       really nice and the breakfast was even better. Afterwards I spent around
       3 hours at the pyramid complex. It was truly amazing. Of all the tourist
       type places I've ever been to, this was my absolute favorite. The size of
       the 2 pyramids is astounding, not to mention the surrounding architecture
       of the city on the Avenue of the Dead. I've got lots of pics and a few
       vids in my dropbox. I decided I wanted to explore the town some before I
       headed back into Mexico City. At this point, I'm anxious to get out to 
       the Yucatán so I got a bus ticket for Oaxaca. Expecting about a 6 hour
       drive, we made several stops and the traffic in Mexico City is insane, so
       it ended up being about a 9 hour drive. That was pretty exhausting. Got
       to Oaxaca about 130 in the morning last night and got a cheap hotel 
       across the street from the bus station. I got plenty of sleep last night
       but I'm still feeling exhausted, so I'm going to spend another day here
       in Oaxaca. No real plan as of yet, just to find some food and mail home
       this blanket I bought at Teotihuacán (pic of it in dropbox). Needed 
       something to remember my new favorite place on Earth. I'm sure I'll be 
       back someday when I find someone as crazy as me willing to fly into
       Mexico City to go check them out. Honestly if I could do yesterday over
       again, I would've spent more time at the complex and stayed an extra 
       night out there, and just gotten up early to head to Oaxaca. Oh well,
       this whole trip has been a learning experience and I'm definitely no 
       expert on this solo international travel stuff...yet. Feeling super lazy
       today, and I have no real plan for the next few days, so when I get all
       that figured out I'll post it here. Hope you enjoy the pics and vids
       from yesterday. It was definitely the highlight of my trip thus far.</p>

    <h2 class="even">Update 4/3</h2>
    <p>So once upon a time in Mexico...I woke up in San Luis Potosí and headed
       for the bus station. When you're trying to get 400km in a day, and bus
       tickets are like 8 bucks, well that doesn't take a genius. So off to 
       Mexico City. I haven't seen anything like Mexico City since Cairo. It's
       huge, it's a maze, everything is painted in these bright strange colors,
       just take a look at the photos. Sorry they're all from out of a bus 
       window, but you get the idea. So I get off the bus at the station and 
       I'm in a daze. Thousands of people, no clue which way is the exit, so I
       decide to spark up a cigarrette (I wanted to quit on this trip, but $2
       a pack?!) and tried to get my bearings. I'm standing there maybe 45 
       seconds and out of thousands of people these 2 fucking cops walk right
       up to me. Thankfully, they look like normal cops, and not those special
       forces looking guys I saw back in Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. They start
       asking me something and I just respond with "habla ingles?" To which I 
       get no response and they motion for me to remove my backpack and put it
       on the ground in front of me. One starts digging thru it, the other asks
       for my ID. "Drogas?" one asked. "No" I replied. "Armas?" Again I shook 
       my head no. I decided to pull my Swiss Army knife out of my pocket and 
       showed him. He looked unimpressed and I pointed to the taser I have in 
       the mesh pocket on the side of my bag. He takes a look at it, and the 
       other cop decides to give up. There's like 4 main zippers on my backpack
       and he gave up after digging thru the first 2 after finding only 
       my clothes and some charging cables for my phone and laptop. I mean, I 
       kinda get it. I was sticking out like a sore thumb. Only white guy there
       with a bigger backpack than anyone else. I guess they were satisfied
       after seeing it's not stuffed to the brim with coke or something. 
       That and I was as cooperative as I could've been. The cop handed me my
       ID and they just walked off. OK, so time to get the fuck out of here, 
       I'm thinking. Find the entrance to the bus station. You know that scene
       from Men in Black where Will Smith walks into the MIB headquarters for 
       the first time, and it's like this intergalactic waystation? That's 
       what I felt like. I wish I got pics of this place but I was still so 
       shook up over the cop thing I just wanted to keep moving. I walk outside
       the bus station, still no real plan and realize if I take one step into
       this maze of a city, I'm getting lost, GPS or no. Ok, back into the bus
       station! I find a terminal that says Teotihuacán, exactly where I want 
       to go. Two dollars and a bus leaving in 5 minutes. Awesome! Drops me off
       on the north end of the pyramid complex. The town of Teotihuacán is so
       cool. Imagine Santa Fe, but like 100 times better. All kinds of shops,
       not too crowded, and everything is decked out in Mayan shit. It's really
       cool. I walked down to the pyramid complex entrance about 630, but they
       were closed for the evening. So I walked back to the hotel, ate some 
       food, went to my room and here we are. Tomorrow is going to kick so much
       ass. Freaking cannot wait to get to those pyramids!!!</p><br>

    <h2 class="odd">Update 4/2</h2>
    <p>Today was a long bus ride. Woke up in Linares. The bus station was about
       a mile walk from the hotel. I caught a bus to the town of Matehuala, 
       which was about 6 hours away, where I switched buses and rode another 2
       hours or so down to the town of San Luis Potosí. SLP is a big city. 
       Honestly if everything wasn't in spanish, you'd think it was McAllen or
       Brownsville or something. The best part of the ride today was the first
       hour outside Linares. We took this winding road thru the mountains, the
       same range that extends all the way up to Monterrey. After that it was
       desert. Honestly the scenery reminded me a lot of the trip Ricky and I 
       took to the Grand Canyon a few years back. A lot of it looked like New
       Mexico and a lot of it looked like Arizona. It's that desert look with
       sparse hills/mountains with all types of cacti and other desert plants.
       I took a lot of pics out the bus window and they're uploaded to my
       dropbox. When I got to SLP there were about 6 hotels within walking
       distance of the bus station. At this point I'm kinda anxious to get out
       to the Mayan ruins. Tomorrow I'm going to bus it to Mexico City. It's 
       gonna be another long bus ride, but I feel like it would take me days 
       hitchhike down there. My only goal for Mexico City is to see 
       Teotihuacán. After that I'll probably bus it to Oaxaca, tool around for
       a day, and then bus it out to the Yucatán. Then the fun really begins.
       Mayan ruins, pristine beaches, tropical weather, jungles, howler monkeys.
       Oh man it's gonna kick ass.</p><br>

    <h2 class="even">Update 4/1 morning</h2>
    <p>Well I woke up feeling pretty weird. With the 10 miles of walking in the
       Mexican sol, I think I overdid it a little yesterday. I'm worried if I
       press on today I'll just make myself sick. So I paid for another night 
       in this nice hotel here in Linares where I'm gonna sleep some more and
       do some planning for the next few days. Time for a siesta but hit me up
       on WhatsApp anytime. Pic is from rooftop of Linares hotel.</p><br>

    <h2 class="odd">Update 3/31 evening</h2>
    <p>Again, what a day. After the interview I wandered thru Monterrey. I 
       uploaded a map of my route thru the city. It was 8.5 miles before the 
       gas station where I got my first ride. Nice guy, gave me a ride about 10
       miles south. Let me out at an Oxxo (gas stations that are everywhere 
       here) and the first truck I asked gave me a ride into Santiago, about 
       another 20-30 miles south. There were 3 guys and me in this truck, and
       I couldn't understand any of them. Like at all. They were absolutely
       hilarious. They offered me a cerveza and I showed them my bottle of 
       water. They laughed and I'm pretty sure I heard pinche cabrón. They
       were speaking that rapid fire español and literally every sentence I 
       heard chinga/chingada. They kept asking me questions and when I 
       responded with 'no se' they just kept laughing at me. Honestly I'm 
       pretty sure the whole situation would have made a lot of people 
       uncomfortable, but I thought it was awesome. I snuck a pic from
       the backseat, it's the one with the older fellow driving. They let me 
       out at an Oxxo in Santiago, where I walked a couple more hours and had
       the best (and cheapest) barbacoa tacos I've ever had. I ended up at
       a Pemex (the other major gas station here) which is where I met Ezekial.
       This guy was awesome. He spoke literally no english, but spoke real slow
       for me and miraculously I feel like I had pretty great conversation with
       him. He drove me down to Linares, which is where I'm at now. When we got
       to town, he drove me around a little bit and we ended up at a barber 
       shop (literally on this guy's front porch, great pic of it in dropbox) 
       where I waited and chatted while he got his hair cut. After he was done
       he drove me to the hotel I'm at now. He said a prayer for me and asked
       God to protect me on my journey. It's been things like this that have me
       somewhat overwhelmed and emotional. I'm not naíve. I know what I'm doing
       is kinda crazy and relatively dangerous. I've put my faith in the 
       everyday people of a country I know nothing about, and it's been paying
       dividends out the ass. I can't explain it, it's just amazing. I'll never
       look at Mexico the same again. The war with the narcos/cartels is 
       definitely very real. All the locals talk about it. There's definitely a
       horrible situation going on down here with extreme violence, but I fear
       the American media has hyped the situation up so much that most people
       would never even imagine that the overwhelming majority of the Mexican 
       population are wonderful, friendly, generous people. The Polizia look
       mean as fuck. They drive around in these tricked out trucks with this
       gate type thing they stand on in the back with machine gun mounts. Mostly       M-16s, but in Nuevo Laredo I saw one sporting a .50 cal. They're decked
       out head to toe in Kevlar and wear fucking ski masks so all you see is
       their eyes. This morning when I was walking thru Monterrey, I rounded a 
       corner in a barrio I was a little nervous about, and found myself 
       immediately face-to-face with 2 of these guys holding M-16s. They either
       saw my hesitation or my eyes widen, cause they both gave me a gentle nod
       and I just kept walking. Honestly it made me feel a little better. 
       Considering these guys are armed to the fucking teeth, I get the feeling
       dicking with some gringo backpacker is super low on their priority list.
       Well that's probably enough for tonight. Ezekial convinced me to take a
       bus from Linares to San Luis Potosí. Apparently it's super beautiful and
       all the guys at the barber shop were talking about how much safer it is
       there, especially considering what I'm doing. So who am I to argue with 
       the locals? Check the dropbox link, got a couple dozen or so more pics 
       added. The bus ride will be pretty long tomorrow, so the day will
       probably be pretty tame by comparison. I love you all. Thanks for reading
       and chatting with me on WhatsApp. Makes me feel not so far from home.</p>

    <p>Interview went fantastic. Only thing is they're really wanting to fill
       this position as soon as possible, so I told them if they really wanted
       to move forward, I would come home April 15th. So I'm going to be 
       checking my email to see what's next. Currently packing my bag and about
       to head towards the highway to hitch a ride south.</p><br>

    <h2 class="odd">Update 3/30</h2>
    <p>Well holy hell what a couple days it's been. Crossed the Rio Grande into        Nuevo Laredo yesterday morning about 630am. Walked about 5-7 miles thru
       the city and was able to hitch a ride from a trucker headed to Monterrey.       Finding free wifi down here is tricky. None of the usual shops have it,
       and even after purchasing a Telcel SIM card with data, it works but the 
       coverage is spotty even in the middle of the city. I ended up getting a 
       hotel for the night and was able to connect to their internet. Since then       I've upgraded my Verizon service to global. Think that should work better       moving forward. Anyhow, I woke up today exhausted and slightly sunburned.       Been walking about the city and eating random food from street vendors,         which are literally on every corner here. My spanish sucks, but I know 
       enough to get by. Started to hear it a little better too. I'm staying in        the same hotel again tonight, because I need reliable internet for a 
       Skype interview I have with a company back in Austin tomorrow morning.
       Tomorrow after the interview I'll be headed south toward San Luis Potosi.       Not sure if I'll make it that far, but that's the plan. As far 
       as safety and everything, I never really felt unsafe anywhere, even the
       border town. The people here are very friendly, and as soon as I start 
       speaking my shit spanish, many reply with shit english and we make it
       work from there. It's been a bit stressful at times, mostly because of
       the language barrier, but the experience of everything so far is totally
       making it worth it. </p><br>
